This study uses a partial least square structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) to analyse survey data gathered from 290 managers of manufacturing Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Ghana. This study finds that pressure from supply chain stakeholders substantially drives manufacturing SMEs' CSC practices. This study confirms that EIEC negatively moderates the relationship between supply chain stakeholder pressure and CSC practices. Finally, this study confirms the complementarity between CIO and EIEC through moderating effects between supply chain stakeholder pressure and CSC practices. This study advances circular supply chain management (CSCM) literature by testing a research framework that examines important but rarely studied roles of CIO and EIEC in SMEs' CSC practices adoption under supply chain stakeholder pressure through institutional and resource orchestration perspectives. © 2024 The Authors.

Integrating perspectives from the resource- and competence-based views of the firm and signaling theory, we posit that founders’ start-up experience and the initial presence of corporate or university shareholders can mitigate challenges associated with hiring and facilitate the recruitment of employees in the nascent stages of a firm. Moreover, we propose that early-stage hiring will be more likely in start-ups that combine such a strong set of initial competences and resources with a strategic orientation towards innovation.

We first provide a theoretical background for the concept of Jupsang, which originates from the ancient literature of Sun Tsu and Lao Tsu and the modern literature of Maoism and Deng Xiaoping in China. We used a grounded theory approach to obtain five dimensions of the Jupsang concept: agility orientation, innovation orientation, vigilant orientation, market awareness orientation, and visionary orientation. Items were generated through 12 in-depth interviews in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and mainland China and were included in a questionnaire, which we used to collect data from two large forums in Hong Kong, where 440 middle and senior executives from China attended. Using SPSS Version 25 and following the scale development procedures provided by Churchill and De Villis, we found the Jupsang scale reliable and valid. This paper contributes to providing a brand new scale for strategic leadership. Practically, it can enhance the relationship between a leader and his/her followers. Finally, we provided limitations and directions for future research. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

There are several studies that define the key intangible resources and abilities of professional employees but there is limited research that examines all of them collectively. Therefore, the aim of this study is to improve our understanding of professional workers' various intangible resources and capabilities by proposing the result-oriented capability (ROC) construct and its subdimensions by analyzing existing literature on knowledge workers, professional employees, psychology and management. The proposed model was empirically tested using the data gathered from 384 professional workers that worked in knowledge-intensive business services (p-KIBS). Construct reliability and validity are analyzed using the IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) and the Analysis of Moments Structure (AOMS). This research proposes and confirms that ROC has reflective sub-dimensions such as professional expertise, relational capability, operational capability and innovation orientation. The study's findings provide important insights into how to improve professional workers' capabilities. The new measures can be used as diagnostic tools for professional worker recruitment, assessment and training. This can be beneficial for individual professional workers with larger implications for people management, training and development and organizational success. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {One of the critical topics in contemporary innovation management literature concerns what constitutes innovation capability (IC) at the firm level. There have been many attempts to conceptualize and operationalize this capability. Still, they either fail to discriminate the elements that characterize IC or to present consistent, comparable elements across distinct models or frameworks. This paper reports the results of a systematic approach to formulate a firm-level IC framework. To do so, the authors conducted an extensive systematic literature review, screened 19,589 papers, and analyzed in detail 186 documents that directly address empirical or theoretical elements of IC. The researchers cross-analyzed these papers for direct and indirect references to ICs (and related concepts, such as innovation orientation, innovation competence, and innovativeness) and generated thematic categories. We drew on a hybrid approach moving between inductive and deductive coding and theme development. We adopted an ex-ante theoretical perspective of the propensity/ability axis built upon the willingness–ability approach and the dynamic capability lens. The proposed synthetizing framework is coherent with Teece's (2014) ordinary and dynamic capabilities. It comprises two sets of elements: on one hand, structural and contextual antecedents that characterize an organization's propensity toward innovation and, on the other hand, actions and resource-related capacities that act as causal mechanisms that, articulated within functions—sensing, seizing, and transforming—constitute the ability to generate innovation. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Small and medium-sized firms (SMEs) are important in enhancing the economy, driving innovation, and enhancing competitiveness. Consequently, they play a substantial role in enhancing the overall operational efficacy of enterprises. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the impact of market orientation and entrepreneurial orientation on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) operating in the Pakistani manufacturing sector. Additionally, the study sought to determine the mediating effect of innovation in the link between these orientations and SME performance. Data was collected from 381 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) operating in Pakistan using a self-administered questionnaire. Out of the total surveys collected, 360 met the criteria for conducting a detailed analysis. The study utilized a structured equation modelling technique by SMART PLS 4 to evaluate the influence of Market Orientation (MO), Entrepreneurial Orientation (EO), and Innovation (INO) on the performance of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). The findings of the study demonstrated a notable association between Market Orientation (MO), Entrepreneurial Orientation (EO), and Firm Performance (FP), wherein innovation played a crucial intermediary function within this framework. The aforementioned findings highlight the significant significance of market orientation (MO), entrepreneurial orientation (EO), and innovation orientation (INO) in the attainment of success for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This study serves as a significant reference for both scholars and practitioners who are interested in gaining a deeper understanding of the effects of market orientation (MO), entrepreneurial orientation (EO), and innovation orientation (INO) on the performance of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

	abstract = {Purpose: The study aims to explore whether there is diversity of occupational culture among IT workers. Prior work conceptualizes IT occupational culture (ITOC) as based around six distinctive values (ASPIRE) but has not explored whether there is variation in ITOC. Design/methodology/approach: Survey data from 496 New Zealand IT workers was used to create factors representing IT occupational values based on the ASPIRE tool. Hierarchical cluster analysis and discriminant analysis were applied to identify distinctive segments of ITOC. Findings: Four ITOC segments were identified: fun-lovers, innovators, independents and institutionalists. These differed in the relative emphasis ascribed to the ITOC values with each segment being distinguished by 1–2 dominant values. Segment membership varied according to level of responsibility and birth country. Institutionalists and innovators had higher concern about organizational and IT issues than fun-lovers and independents. Job satisfaction was lowest among innovators and highest along institutionalists. Research limitations/implications: This study challenges the concept of a unified ITOC, suggesting that ITOC is pluralistic. It also theorizes about interactions between ITOC, individual motivation and values and national culture. Practical implications: Management needs to be cognizant of the fact that IT occupational culture is not homogeneous and different IT occupational segments require unique management approaches, and that their own values may not match those of others in IT work. By understanding ITOC segments, managers can tailor support, assign tasks appropriately and design teams to optimize synergies and avoid conflict. Originality/value: This study reveals the existence of ITOC segments and theorizes about the relationship of these to innovation-orientation, job satisfaction, individual motivation, work styles and national culture. The combination of cluster and discriminant analysis is a valuable replicable inductive method that is underrepresented in Information Systems (IS) research. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This study empirically examined the moderating effect of customer participation as information providers (CPI), co-developers (CPC), and innovators (CPN), on the relationship between a firm's innovation orientation and cost-based financial performance. We focus on two types of innovation orientation: exploitative and exploratory innovation. Finally, we used data from 272 manufacturing industry respondents of the Korean Innovation Survey. The results show a non-linear U-shaped relationship between exploitative innovation and financial performance. Further, CPI (CPN) positively (negatively) moderates this relationship. This study provides important theoretical and managerial implications for adopting and managing customer participation in a firm's innovation orientation. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

One recent approach to enhancing sustainability in manufacturing is the development of innovations in the pursuit of achieving higher eco-efficiency. This study delves into this approach by investigating the effect of technological innovation on eco-efficiency. In addition, this research examines the role of co-innovation orientation in relation to suppliers and customers. In the empirical exercise, an ordered probit model is applied to a sample of 791 manufacturing companies from Peru. Our research reveals a positive association between the distinct types of technological innovation and eco-efficiency, with process innovation yielding the most substantial effect. In terms of co-innovation orientation, we find co-innovation with suppliers to be more effective in driving eco-efficiency through product and process innovations, while co-innovation with customers seems more influential through product-service innovation. We also found that, for companies co-innovating with suppliers (CIS), complementary co-innovation with customers does not influence eco-efficiency. Conversely, for those co-innovating with customers (CIC), the fact that they also co-innovate with suppliers significantly boosts eco-efficiency. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

Design/methodology/approach: This study was designed by the quantitative method, and the research model was developed based on the resource-based view (RBV) theory of 211 managers from Israeli firms using SmartPls3 software. Findings: The main finding that emerges from this study is that marketing innovation orientation serves as a full mediator in the relationship between supply chain resilience (SCR) and NPP as well as in the relationship between supply chain integration (SCI) and NPP. Thus, companies that wish to achieve a competitive advantage over their rivals should improve and strengthen their marketing innovation orientation. By doing so, they enhance the relationship between SCM and NPP. Practical implications: The findings provide an applicable guideline for marketing managers. Managers should be ready to adapt to customers’ demands, environmental changes and, most importantly, disruptive events in a dynamic environment. Originality/value: The current study sheds light on the mechanism for NPP via integrating suppliers, customers and the organization. So, managers should adopt SCR and integration to strengthen their marketing innovation orientation in order to achieve NPP. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

We analyzed data on published papers, patents, and other panel data of firms in China's organic chemical industry between 1998 and 2015. The results show that (a) NTC and RTC positively affect firm innovation quantity, but NTC's effect is weaker than that of RTC; (b) NTC positively affects firm innovation quality, whereas RTC negatively affects it; (c) NTC's positive effect on firm innovation quantity is strengthened by science convergence, whereas RTC's positive effect on firm innovation quantity is weakened by it; and (d) NTC's positive effect on firm innovation quality is strengthened by science convergence, while RTC's negative effect on firm innovation quality is weakened by it. By shedding light on these relationships, this study contributes to the literature on technology convergence and recombinant innovation theory, and offers valuable management implications, particularly in terms of selecting appropriate convergence strategies for different innovation orientations. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The research expects to give full play to the role of venture capital in corporate innovation and enhance the development capability of enterprises. Based on Propensity Score Matching (PSM) model, the characteristics of venture capital and startup enterprises are analyzed, and the innovation of venture capital is discussed. Next, the PSM model is used to analyze the innovation of venture capital intervention in enterprises from risk probability intervention, probability evaluation, matching equilibrium validity test, matching results analysis, different venture capital, and different background risks. The results show that the difference of standardized mean is close to 0, which accords with the equilibrium test. The significant impact of venture capital intervention on the Number of Invention Patent Applications (NIPA) and Number of Utility Model Patent Applications (NUMPA) is 0.1 and 0.01, respectively. Venture capital intervention has a significantly positive impact on NIPA and NUMPA but has no significant positive impact on Number of Design Patent Applications (NDPA). The impact of joint venture capital intervention on the NIPA, NUMPA, and NDPA is 0.0874, 0.0635, and 0.1213, respectively. Hence, the intervention of joint venture capital can greatly promote the increase of Number of Patent Applications (NPA), especially, NIPA, and NUMPA. Compared with private venture capital, joint venture capital plays a greater role in promoting the growth of NPA and NIPA. Compared with private venture capital and foreign venture capital, national venture capital has a stronger innovation orientation and a longer investment cycle, which can greatly improve innovation performance, such as NIPA, while private venture capital and foreign venture capital have a less significant impact on enterprise innovation performance. The results demonstrate that the foreign capital sharing assessment based on the PSM model can be a good predictor of the performance of startups. It is hoped that the research results can provide a reference for the development of startups. Copyright © 2021 Han.},

These differences present challenges when leading any change. Process mining (PM) tools can optimize process value and eliminate non-added-value activities in FSMEs based on “Event Logs”. The present study investigates how a PM project is implemented in an FSME operating in the agri-food sector, focusing on challenges faced in every project phase to extract the most appropriate process that eliminates all sources of waste and bottleneck cases. Drawing upon the L*Lifecycle methodology combined with quality and lean management tools such as the fishbone diagram, Pareto diagram, and overall equipment efficiency (OEE), this study applied a PM project to a manufacturing process for an FSME operating in the agri-food sector. To achieve theoretical production capacity (TPC) and customer satisfaction, the method was analyzed and optimized using Disco and ProM toolkits. The results analysis using Disco and ProM toolkits gave clues about the organizational and technical causes behind the manufacturing process’s inefficiency. First, OEE showed that the studied FSME is struggling with equipment availability. Then, the implementation of the L*Lifecycle methodology allowed for the identification of five critical causes. An action plan to eliminate causes was proposed to the FSME managers. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Economic sustainability involves the development of an organisation that meets its future needs through an integrated policy, planning, and social learning process. The purpose of this study was to investigate the mediating role of competitive advantage in the relationship between strategic orientation and economic sustainability under unpredictable circumstances. This study collected quantitative data from a total of 284 halal small and medium enterprises (SMEs) from Indonesia through structured interviews. Data were analysed using partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). Moreover, this study adopted artificial neural network (ANN) analysis for a model-free estimation using non-linear, multilayer, and parallel regression. The results revealed statistically significant and positive effect of strategic orientation on economic sustainability. Additionally, this study found that competitive advantage expanded the effect of strategic orientation on economic sustainability. Findings of ANN analysis confirm high prediction accuracy of the model. Findings of the sensitivity analysis highlighted the importance of innovation, network and technological orientation, and the positive effect of competitive advantage on halal SMEs economic sustainability. In order to achieve long-term economic sustainability, halal SMEs should therefore focus on innovation capacity, vertical and horizontal networking and adoption of the latest technologies. The uniqueness of this study focused on the strategic orientation and value of competitive advantage of halal SMEs towards economic sustainability. Additionally, this study was the first to develop hybrid SEM–neural network analysis to apply sensitivity analysis for the evaluation of the contribution of each exogenous predictor towards the endogenous construct. © 2022, The Author(s).},

This study aims to hint the gap of knowledge related to the association between the owners and managers’ personality traits and innovation orientation of small business. The empirical research includes data from two hundred small businesses in different branches of industry. The results interestingly showed that high levels of both conscientiousness and extraversion among owners/managers have positive, but insignificant, impacts on the performance of their small enterprises. The knowledge acquired is critical to organizational innovation and yields lessons that can be used to transform how individual contributors are leveraged within organizations.

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to study the impact of technologies on the welfare of society through the value co-creation processes that Non-Profit Organizations (NPOs) carry out with social enterprises. Based on the literature on Cross-Sector Social Interactions, the research was aimed at evaluating to what extent certain technological variables (innovation orientation, omnichannel, and ICTs) condition the fact that an NPO, a key agent of social innovation, co-creates (programmes, projects, activities or services) with a social enterprise to improve the social impact and the achievement of the organizational mission of both entities in favour of society. To this end, a research model was developed and its main hypotheses tested with data collected from a sample of Spanish 104 NPOs that collaborate, to a greater or lesser extent, with social enterprises. The study employs partial least squares structural equation modelling in SmartPLS. The article is framed within the most current lines of research on the identification of resources, in this case technological, conditioning the impact of NPOs on the welfare of society. In this sense, this research concludes that the development of a real innovative culture by NPOs and the general use of ICTs are key factors, through the full implementation of an omnichannel strategy, in driving the development of co-creation processes that have a strong transformative impact on the well-being of society. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.},

The study draws from the leader–member exchange (LMX) theory to propose that the quality of exchange the leaders perceive with the team members may provide a useful cue to identify the key elements and processes that may help drive team innovation. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative study using a hybrid approach was used, and a thematic analysis was performed. The data were based on 25 interviews collected from strategic leaders using the long interview technique. Findings: The findings revealed themes and factors influencing innovation orientation among leaders and team members. Five themes were identified, namely modeling leadership behavior, autonomy and psychological safety for teams, organizational structure and technology, innovation and the decision-making process and innovation during times of uncertainty. Research limitations/implications: Because of the purposefully chosen sample of only leaders who were involved in the innovation process, the research results may lack generalizability. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to corroborate the finding using a sample of teams involved in the innovation process. Practical implications: A conceptual model is proposed with guidance for implementing innovation decisions and strategies in practice. Originality/value: While the strategic leadership and team innovation literature emphasizes the interaction between leaders and team members, research on how these interactions unfold is still nascent. This paper fulfills these needs from a strategic leader’s perspective. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The present study addresses this knowledge gap by developing a strategic roadmap that explains how businesses can leverage Industry 4.0 technologies to introduce sustainability into innovative practices. For this purpose, the study conducts a systematic review of extant literature to identify Industry 4.0 functions for sustainable innovation and applies interpretive structural modeling to devise the promised roadmap. The results offer interesting insights into Industry 4.0 applications for sustainable innovation. The strategic roadmap developed reveals that Industry 4.0 enables sustainable innovation through 11 functions. Industry 4.0 and the underlying digital technologies and principles allow businesses to improve interfunctional collaboration and better integrate with internal and external stakeholders. Industry 4.0 further improves the knowledge base and advanced manufacturing competency and promotes organizational capabilities valuable to sustainable innovation such as green absorptive capacity, sustainable partnership, and sustainable innovation orientation. Through these functions, Industry 4.0 subsequently enhances green process innovation capacity and the ability to develop or reintroduce eco-friendly products economically and competitively. Overall, the roadmap explains the complex precedence relationships among the 11 sustainable innovation functions of Industry 4.0, offering important implications for businesses that seek to leverage Industry 4.0 sustainability implications and manage sustainable development. © 2021 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

This study focuses on the holistic understanding of stakeholder interests and introduces the organizational capability of stakeholder understanding, defined as the degree to which a firm understands its stakeholder system. In particular, this study empirically examined the antecedents and consequences of stakeholder understanding in a green product innovation context. Through a two-stage survey approach, data were collected from 181 innovation professionals working in United States based manufacturing firms. Using hierarchical regression analysis, hypotheses about antecedents and consequences of stakeholder understanding are tested. Results show that stakeholder understanding is higher in firms with high innovation orientation, and lower in environments with high complexity. Results also show that stakeholder understanding has positive effects on three types of firm performance: green performance, market performance, and firm innovativeness. In addition, results of piecewise linear regression reveal that only for firms that exceed the median level of green orientation there is a positive relationship between green orientation and stakeholder understanding. The study's implications are that stakeholder understanding is a relevant capability for firms that aim to develop better and greener product innovations. To obtain stakeholder understanding, firms should strive for innovation and excel in green orientation, because only for truly green firms, green orientation helps to develop stakeholder understanding. © 2023 The Authors},

Innovation orientation has been commonly used to assess an organization's innovative culture. To date, most innovation orientation research has explored its relationship with performance. However, the literature is unclear as to what innovative companies do differently to achieve superior performance. This study advances innovation orientation research by examining differing business practices of high versus low innovative Japanese firms. The various business practices include culture management, open innovation, analytics, innovation management software, crowdsourcing, design thinking, measuring innovation, stage-gate, and scientific discovery. Using data from 261 Japanese firms, this study finds that high innovators, as compared to low innovators, are more likely to engage in many of these business practices. Until this study, some of these business practices were not empirically shown to be correlated with high innovators, much less explored in the same study. This paper also offers a stepwise approach for executives seeking to enhance competitiveness via innovation. Specifically, executives should first look to creating an innovation orientation and subsequently implement such business practices. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this preliminary empirical research study is to understand how environmental disruption such as brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic induces shifts in organisational culture, information security culture and subsequently employee information security compliance behaviour. Design/methodology/approach: A single-organisation case study was used to develop understanding from direct experiences of organisational life. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected using a sequential mixed methods approach, with the qualitative phase following the quantitative to achieve complementarity and completeness in analysis. For the quantitative phase, 48 useful responses were received after a questionnaire was sent to all 150–200 employees. For the qualitative phase, eight semi-structured interviews were conducted. Statistical software was used to analyse the quantitative data and NVivo software was used to analyse the qualitative data. Findings: The pandemic-induced environmental disruption manifested as a sudden shift to work-from-home for employees, and relatedly an increase in cybercrime. The organisational response to this gave rise to shifts in both organisational and information security culture towards greater control (rule and goal orientations) and greater flexibility (support and innovation orientations), most significantly with information security culture flexibility. The net effect was an increase in employee information security compliance. Originality/value: The vast literature on organisational culture and information security culture was drawn on to theoretically anchor and develop parsimonious measures of information security culture. Environmental disruptions such as those caused by the pandemic are unpredictable and their effects uncertain, hence, the study provides insight into the consequences of such disruption on information security in organisations. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {A firm’s connections into its ecosystem influences its ability to innovate. Much research on innovation ecosystems has examined high technology firms and locations and has used interview, survey, or science and technology data methods. Our study focuses on a resource-based ecosystem—agri-food in a medium-sized region—and explores a novel method using media sources to identify ecosystem links. We use this method to capture the innovation ecosystem around two plant-based protein firms and a conventional food processor in Winnipeg, Canada. We extract organisational actors from the full text of business and news articles, link co-occurring actors in social networks, and use modularity partitioning to detect communities in these networks. Our results show that the focal agri-food firms vary in their ecosystem associations, with little duplication in the actor organisations across the different firms’ networks. The plant-based protein firm networks had a greater innovation orientation than was noticeable in the established food producer’s network, particularly with industry and civic association intermediaries, government, and other agricultural companies. Insights from using the method and implications of the findings are discussed. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

It is urgent to use digital technology to realize digital transformation. In this process, digital dynamic capability and digital innovation are significant for textile firms to achieve digital transformation performance. Drawing on the data from 367 questionnaires of Chinese textile firms, we apply multiple regression to examine how a firm's digital transformation is affected by adopting digital technology. A conceptual model based on framework of resource–capability–performance is developed to examine how adoption of digital technology, digital dynamic capability, and digital innovation orientation affects a firm's digital transformation performance. The results indicate that the positive relationship between digital technology adoption and digital transformation performance is less significant; this path is fully mediated through digital dynamic capability. Digital innovation orientation has a positive moderating effect and that the efficiency digital innovation has the most significant moderating effect among all digital innovation types. In addition, compared with textile firms in the low level of digital technology adoption, the firms in the high-level group show a significant positive relationship between digital technology adoption and digital transformation performance. These findings confirm the validity of the model and contribute to existing literature on technology efforts in firms and provide guidelines to help managers implement informed decisions about digital transformation. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

Data were obtained from 41 responses and were analyzed using partial least square structural equation modeling. Findings: This study discovers that firms in Taiwan practice halal business as they possess halal perceived value and innovation orientation. In addition, the interplays of the antecedents, the internal and external drivers, also play an excellent role in shaping the firms’ practices on halal business. Research limitations/implications: Despite the implications, this study was built under several limitations that are potentially addressed by future research. The limitations lay in the low response rate, indistinctive analysis based on the firms’ market orientations (domestic or international) and the exclusion of other relevant variables to the conceptual model. Practical implications: Practically, this study clarifies that firms in a Muslim minority country can be encouraged to engage in halal business in several ways. Those with a good understanding of halal usefulness are oriented to innovation, exposed to external pressures about halal business and equipped with specific internal settings that can translate the halal business phenomenon as an opportunity, not a threat.

	abstract = {The agricultural and agri-food sectors have substantial environmental impacts due to the great volumes of food, energy, water, and packaging waste that these businesses generate. Eco-innovations present an important opportunity to mitigate this effect. Even though eco-innovation seeks to reduce environmental damage in the food and agri-food sectors, researchers have paid slight attention to the role of eco-innovation in agribusiness; however, several insights suggest that it would be worthwhile to examine the motivation drivers toward the adoption of eco-innovations. The current study sheds light on the driving forces of eco-innovation and its impact on sustainable business growth. This paper tests a set of hypothesized relationships that focus on a sample of 306 Tunisian enterprises. We harness structural equation modelling to examine the relationship between the driving factors of eco-innovation and enterprises’ sustainable business growth by analysing the eco-innovation strategy's mediating effects. The findings reveal: (1) regulatory-side drivers constitute the most influential factor that motivates entrepreneurs to adopt an eco-innovation strategy, (2) there is a positive relationship between eco-innovation strategy and enterprises’ sustainable business growth, and (3) eco-innovation strategy plays a fully mediating role between the driving factors and enterprises’ sustainable business growth. The present study led us to consider that an entrepreneur with an emotional attachment to the environment is designed as a decisive driver for eco-innovation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Background: In recent years, makerspaces have become increasingly common venues of STEM education and are rapidly being incorporated into undergraduate programs. These spaces give students and instructors access to advanced design technology and facilitate the incorporation of a wide variety of projects into the curriculum; however, their impacts on students are not yet fully understood. Using matched survey responses (i.e., repeated measures) from undergraduate students enrolled in engineering courses that assigned a makerspace-based project, we evaluate how the use of a university makerspace impacts students’ attitudes towards design, engineering, and technology. Further, we examine whether there are differences based on students’ year in program, gender, and race. Results: Paired t-tests were used to analyze whether and how nine factors changed within individual students over one semester. Analyses revealed that students who visited the facility showed significant gains in measures of innovation orientation, design self-efficacy, innovation self-efficacy, technology self-efficacy, belonging to the makerspace, and belonging to the engineering community. Subsequently, repeated measures analyses of variance (RMANOVAs) on the students who visited the makerspace revealed significant main effects of students’ year in program, gender, and race, as well as interactional effects of both year in program and race with time. Conclusions: These results affirm the value of incorporating makerspace-based projects into STEM curricula, especially during early coursework. However, our analyses revealed consistent gender gaps in measures of self-efficacy before and after using the makerspace. Similarly, gains in belonging to the makerspace were not equal across racial groups. We conclude that while makerspaces are fulfilling some of their promise for educating innovative problem solvers, more attention needs to be paid to avoid reproducing disparities in STEM education that are already experienced by female students and racial minorities. © 2021, The Author(s).},

Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on the theoretical frameworks of the resource-based view and dynamic capability theory, this scholarly inquiry has proposed a comprehensive framework that delineates the relationships amongst imitation, innovation, absorptive capacity (ACAP), innovation performance and financial performance. To scrutinize the proposed research model, bootstrap routines were used through Smart partial least squares to estimate the procedures. To collect the necessary data, a questionnaire and financial statements were acquired from a sample of 100 Iranian firms listed on the Tehran Stock Exchange. The findings of the study have important implications for both scholars and practitioners seeking to enhance firm performance through the effective utilization of imitation, innovation and ACAP. Findings: The results indicate that imitation activities have directly led to the improvement in innovation performance, even in the presence of innovation and ACAP. However, the relationship has not been confirmed by financial performance. Originality/value: Imitation and innovation orientations have been identified as pivotal strategic orientations that can significantly affect firm performance. As far as the authors know, this investigation represents the first comprehensive examination of both imitation and innovation activities as a critical transition in emerging markets (EMs) characterized by complex economies, such as Iran.

	abstract = {Organizational culture (OC) is one of the key factors that enables the development of innovation. A great deal of research has analyzed the characteristics that make up an innovation-focused OC; however, none have unified them. This article analyzes and integrates the literature on the characteristics of an innovation OC. Its objective was to test whether there is a specific set of distinctive characteristics of an innovation-focused OC that, once identified, can be implemented and developed by firms. To this end, this study proposed and tested a model for measuring the innovation orientation of an OC. This study collected samples from small-and medium-sized companies from the oil-producing states of Mexico, obtaining information from 176 companies. To determine the group of characteristics that make up an organizational culture of innovation (OCI), the authors applied non-experimental, descriptive, transactional research with a quantitative approach. Results were obtained through the application of the following statistical techniques: Bonnet test, KMO index, Bartlett’s sphericity, Chi-square, confirmatory factor analysis, Cronbach’s alpha, principal component analysis and structural equations, which made it possible to measure the level of innovation of the OCI of these companies and to determine the characteristics that comprise it. The proposed model allowed us to identify the existence of a specific group of behavioral characteristics that emanate from a company’s personnel and another group of characteristics that arise from the company itself. Both integrated groups determine whether the OC is focused on innovation. The results also confirmed that the level of innovation of a company depends greatly on its personnel. The authors found no previous work that analyzed these characteristics from the joint perspectives of employees, middle managers and managers. This research considered the opinions of these agents, which confers greater veracity to the findings obtained. The limitations and implications are listed at the end of the study. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Firms in IT industries are under constant competitive pressure from incumbent firms and startups to offer innovative products and services. This study explores the effect of mergers and acquisitions (M&As) on firms’ product differentiation in IT industries. The unique characteristics of IT industries, namely hypercompetition, distributed innovation, modularity of products, and the tacit nature of knowledge, make M&As an attractive mechanism to enable IT firms to stay competitive. Drawing on product differentiation theory, we hypothesize a positive effect of M&As on product differentiation and suggest that this relationship is more potent in firms with higher in-house innovation, an exploitative innovation orientation, and under high levels of industry turbulence. We test our hypotheses using M&A transactions from 1996 to 2016 and a unique 10-K textual analysis-based measure of product differentiation. Using the difference-in-differences identification strategy, the following findings are supported: (1) M&As lead to higher product differentiation, (2) in-house innovation capability and exploitation-oriented innovation strategy positively moderate the positive effect of M&As. These results, which are robust to endogeneities and other robustness tests, contribute to theory and managerial practice by shedding light on the role of M&As as an essential mechanism for product innovation and the complementary role of in-house innovation capability and strategy for firms that intend to take advantage of M&As for creating a competitive edge through differentiating their products and services from competitors. These findings have important managerial value, providing an alternative narrative to the current view on M&As in IT industries as a means of absorbing and dismantling the competition. © 2023 by the Association for Information Systems.},

	abstract = {This study provides an XGBoost model to characterize the environmental orientation of innovative firms. This novel approach, using state-of-the-art machine learning methodologies and multiple recognized drivers of eco-innovation, provides solid empirical support for the understanding of the mechanisms that are crucial for firms' transition to a low-carbon economy. Although many drivers have been considered to affect firms’ eco-innovation, our feature selection process using the BorutaShap algorithm demonstrates that few aspects are truly relevant. Furthermore, analyzing a tree surrogate of the final model, our study explores the different paths or combinations of aspects that consistently lead to a specific eco-innovation orientation. The accuracy of the model and the large and complete spectrum of innovative companies in the sample contribute to the generalizability of the results. This study is particularly relevant because the main drivers of firms’ eco-innovative orientation depend on their innovative behavior, indicating that the managerial and policy work has to be directed to raising awareness of the different externalities derived from innovation. On one side, policy regulations should continue to pressure firms with environmental standards. On the other side, managers can stimulate the creation of a corporate innovative culture oriented toward improving operational efficiency (reducing unnecessary costs), improving the workplace environment, and focusing on new customer demands, which, in essence, will guide the organization to be more environmentally and socially responsible. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {Purpose: This research investigates the impact of strategic research and development (R&D) (one led by a firm’s innovation orientation) on stock market performance during the economic disruption caused by the 2016 demonetization of high-value currency notes in India. It shows how firms’ strategic focus on innovation and integrated R&D initiatives can help mitigate shareholders’ losses and protect market value during negative macroeconomic shocks. Design/methodology/approach: We analyzed financial and administrative data from firms listed in the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) 500 index and used the Fama French market model with appropriate instruments accounting for possible endogeneity to identify the impact. To ensure the reliability of our findings, we conducted robustness checks with alternate event windows, estimation methods, and variable measurements. Findings: Strategic R&D plays a crucial role in building resilience against macroeconomic shocks. It effectively mitigated shareholders’ losses in the immediate aftermath of the shock, with an elasticity of abnormal returns of 7.65% on day zero, 13.1% during the first five days and 10.5% after the first fortnight. We also find that firms that are business-to-business (B2B), as well as those that are older and less leveraged, are better able to combat such a shock. Research limitations/implications: The study looked at one shock, namely demonetization. Future research is needed to demonstrate the generalizability of results during other macroeconomic shocks, like the COVID-19 pandemic. The study focuses on relatively near-term impacts, leaving the long-term value-creation effects of strategic R&D unexplored. Practical implications: Innovation orientation acts as a structural enabler, allowing firms to make strategic R&D investments that mitigate losses during macroeconomic shocks. It explains that managers should avoid myopically managing R&D investments and align them with the firm’s innovation focus to enhance value creation. Social implications: While the currency demonetization was widely considered to be detrimental for firms as an unannounced negative monetary shock, our research shows that firms with high levels of strategic R&D were successfully able to counteract such a shock. Originality/value: This is the first study to examine the short-term loss mitigation impact of firms’ focus on innovation and strategic R&D. It emphasizes the role of innovation-focused strategies during economic crises. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Strategic responses to crisis including cost-cutting as retrenchment in the short run, debt financing to preserve the status quo and exit. However, perhaps the most positive is to innovate for renewal. The paper considers how working with an approach to futures and foresight learning, three different SMEs during the Covid pandemic and beyond formed action learning groups and were able to find future opportunities from which innovation ideas for action in the present could be undertaken. The paper considers the meaning of innovation including what Revans saw as an ‘Innovation Paradox’ as a gap between invention and innovation. In SMEs, the importance of informal innovation and an innovation orientation are identified. The meaning futures and foresight learning is considered and the focus on the identification of new opportunities for products and services, delivered by a process of action learning. Findings from three SMEs are presented from meetings that took place during 2021 to 2022, when Covid restrictions were partly in place. They show how each programme begins with opportunity questions for the future which then lead to ideas after a consideration of trends and patterns. Further methods of futures thinking are presented which allow further ideas to be developed for innovation. In each case, ideas are selected for business planning after approval. Discussion of the findings considers the importance of futures and foresight learning combined with action learning for SMEs to become more strategic, future-oriented and creative in seeking opportunities for innovation. © 2023 The Author(s).

Yet, despite this growing body of open innovation research, there are still gaps and limitations. Notably, most prior studies have been conducted in Europe, limiting their generalizability to the rest of the world, and are replicative, exploring performance and competitive outcomes. There is very limited work examining the potential limitations of open innovation. This study extends innovation orientation research and examines the limitations of open innovation in North America. Design/methodology/approach: This study explores the relationships between innovation orientation and performance, open innovation and performance and innovation orientation and open innovation among 386 North American companies. Findings: This study is novel as it examines the relationships between innovation orientation and performance, open innovation and performance and innovation orientation and open innovation among North American companies. The research uncovers a linear relationship between innovation orientation and performance, a correlation between innovation orientation and open innovation and a counterintuitive curvilinear relationship between open innovation and performance. The curvilinear relationship, shaped as an inverted u-shape, suggests there are limitations to the strategy's effectiveness, actionable insight to companies, consultants and scholars alike. In the discussion section, findings are further unpacked with regard to their implications for the scholarly literature. The paper concludes with managerial considerations for creating an innovation orientation and the most effective level of open innovation for maximum competitive and performance implications.

	abstract = {Firm innovation is a complex and multidimensional process that is affected by internal and external factors. Companies and governments have traditionally tried to promote in-house innovation by promoting research and development investment. In an economy characterized by a large percentage of small- and medium-sized enterprises and continuous change toward digital and green transition, many companies struggle to innovate because of their lack of resources, knowledge, or capabilities. In this context, the external links and networks that materialize through active engagement in innovation activities with market and institutional agents are key, and analyzing cooperation for innovation is essential to obtain an overview to promote innovation. This study contributes to the understanding of (1) the drivers in innovative companies that lead to cooperation with external agents for innovation; (2) the relative importance of these drivers for cooperation; (3) the extent to which the eco-innovation orientation of a company affects its engagement in collaborations with other stakeholders; and (4) an understanding of the differences in the cooperation drivers according to the type of collaborator (institutional, market, or both). Using data from the Spanish Technological Innovation Panel and machine-learning techniques, we confirm the importance of internal and external factors, namely public financing, the environmental and social orientation of innovation, and the commitment to innovation. This research also reveals the asymmetric impact of many of the cooperation drivers, and that company cooperation with both market and institutional agents leads to higher innovation performance.

Design/methodology/approach: The researchers developed a conceptual framework based on vigorous literature for this investigation. This study targeted managers from Pakistan's SME sector as respondents and employed cross-sectional data. In total, the authors based this study's findings on 192 valid cases. Findings: The structural equation modeling (SEM) results highlight that innovation orientation (IO), customer orientation (CO), supplier orientation (SO), network orientation (NO) and absorptive capacity (AC) have significant effects on economic sustainability (ES). Moreover, this study's findings show that ES significantly predicts environmental sustainability (ENS). Finally, the results also demonstrate that ES and ENS positively and substantially affect financial performance (FP). Practical implications: This study's findings help SMEs continue sustainable business practices by avoiding adverse environmental effects and ongoing climate changes. This study's findings contribute also to the manufacture of eco-friendly environmental products to reduce the contamination of the environment. Financial institutions and policymakers would boost SME owners' capacity and the obtainability of financial resources to improve Pakistani SMEs’ sustainable economic and environmental performance.

Despite the importance of this technology in people’s financial transactions in improving the management of their financial operations, processes, and lives, there is a lack of empirical evidence about sustainable FinTech services in the Jordanian context. Consequently, this research examines the factors that influence the acceptance of FinTech services, which have a variety of social, environmental, and ecological benefits. This study proposes an integrated model by combining the extended technology acceptance model (TAM) with the perceived enjoyment as an independent variable and electronic word of mouth (eWOM) as a moderator variable simultaneously. A total of 304 responses from Jordanian citizens were analyzed by the quantitative method of partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). The result confirmed that perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment have a significant and positive influence on users’ decision to use FinTech services. Meanwhile, eWOM is found to moderate the relationship between perceived usefulness and Jordanians’ decisions to use FinTech services. Finally, this study provides practical implications for managers to encourage them to provide adequate, reliable, and sustainable services to their customers at a reasonable cost that fit their demands and ultimately improve their living standards.

The target population of the study was 643 micro and small manufacturing firms in Injibara, Dangila, and Tilili; a number provided by Awi zone enterprise development office data during 2021. Data were drawn from a sample of 247 manufacturing firms using cross-sectional primary data collected from wood and metal manufacturing firms in selected towns of Awi Zone. The study adopted descriptive and explanatory designs and used correlation and multiple linear regression analysis to estimate the effect of innovation on firm performance. The regression results revealed that product, process, marketing and organizational innovation were positively and significantly related to firm performance, while product innovation was found to have a strong positive effect on the dependent variable firm performance followed by process and organizational innovation, respectively. However, a weak statistical relationship was reported between marketing innovation and the performance of manufacturing firms than other variables. Hence, firms which have a strong orientation towards product, process, organizational and marketing innovation have better performance in manufacturing firms in the study area. © 2023, The Author(s).},

Design/methodology/approach: Questionnaires completed by business service companies were analyzed using multiple regression analysis (path analysis), including the mediating variable (KM) and moderating variable (TR). The construct was validated with positive outcomes. Findings: Of the eight hypotheses, six were supported. The study results show that strategic, technological, organizational culture and market dimensions of IO positively influence KM. On the other hand, KM plays an important role as a mediator in supporting the relationship between the four dimensions of IO and performance. Moreover, TR, as a moderator, positively affects the relationship between KM and OP.

Based on the stimulus organism response (SOR) model, the objective of this study is to explore the mediating factors that affect knowledge workers' innovative work behavior, and construct a three-level model of the external environment, psychological factors, and individual behavior. This study selected 575 valid samples from 24 high-tech SMEs in Zhongguancun, which is a technology hub in Haidian District, Beijing, China. Through the convenience sampling method, This study analyze the data and perform structural equation modeling (SEM) using AMOS 23.0. The external environment (i.e., organizational climate, innovation orientation) and psychological factors (i.e., intrinsic motivation, psychological safety) have a significant positive impact on innovative work behavior. Psychological factors have the most significant impact on innovative work behavior. Besides, psychological factors also mediate the relationship between the external environment and innovative work behavior. The findings indicated that high-tech SMEs need to formulate scientific innovation-orientation when implementing strategies, and continue to shape a harmonious and equal organizational climate. Furthermore, high-tech SMEs should encourage knowledge workers to speak the truth, express different voices, and stimulate work enthusiasm to improve psychological safety and intrinsic motivation, thereby enhancing knowledge workers' innovative work behavior.  © 2022 Ziqing Xu et al.},

Design/methodology/approach: Hierarchical linear regression modeling presents the linear relations at two decision layers of start-ups, their founders and managers. Data is collected and analyzed from 233 new ventures in Turkey. Findings: Findings of the two and three-way interaction analyses indicate a positive relationship between human capital and innovation capability when social capital and IO are high; however, the relation turns off when low. Research limitations/implications: The study extends the previous works on the proposed link between intellectual capital (IC) resources and innovation, by confirming the moderating role of social capital and IO on the positive association between human capital resources and innovation capability. Practical implications: The results show that for start-up companies, the co-existence of strong social capital and the strategic orientation towards innovation is required for the effective utilization of human capital for generating innovation capability within the organization. Thus, this study highlights the importance of networks, alliances and social relationships, together with the unification of strategic thinking, organizational learning and a culture of innovation for attaining innovation goals, which are crucial for the survival and success of these units.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors used data from 1,850 firms to determine the barriers associated with information and internal capabilities, risks and environment. Findings: The main results of this study confirm that potentially innovative firms of low technological intensity are more likely to ascribe high importance to obstacles associated with information and internal capabilities, when compared with innovative firms. The abandonment of innovative projects, family-operated enterprises and investment in R&D are all related to an increased perception of obstacles to innovation, while investments in information and communication technologies have an opposite effect. Variables as partnerships and export behaviour, have different effects depending on the level of technological intensity. Originality/value: This study investigates the obstacles to innovation of a firm as determined by its characteristics and as measured against its level of technological intensity.

Our explorations specifically reveal that older founders who draw on personal financial resources and combine their innovation orientation with prior managerial experience are most likely to generate the types of innovations that bring new products or services to the market.

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study was to demonstrate a cloud business intelligence model for industrial SMEs. An initial model was developed to accomplish this, followed by validation and finalization of the cloud business intelligence model. Additionally, this research employs a mixed-techniques approach, including both qualitative and quantitative methods. This paper aims to achieve the following objectives: (1) Recognize the Cloud business intelligence concepts. (2) Identify the role of cloud BI in SMEs. (3) Identify the factors that affect the design and presenting a Cloud business intelligence model based on critical factors affecting SMEs during pandemic COVID-19. (4) Discuss the importance of Cloud BI in pandemic COVID-19 for SMEs. (5) Provide managerial implications for using Cloud BI effectively in Iran’s SMEs. Design/methodology/approach: In the current study, an initial model was first proposed, and the cloud business intelligence model was then validated and finalized. Moreover, this study uses a mixed-methods design in which both qualitative and quantitative methods are used. The fuzzy Delphi Method has been applied for parameter validation purposes, and eventually, the Cloud business intelligence model has been presented through exploiting the interpretive structural modeling. The partial least squares method was also applied to validate the model. Data were also analyzed using the MAXQDA and Smart PLS software package. Findings: In this research, from the elimination of synonym and frequently repeated factors and classification of final factors, six main factors, 24 subfactors and 24 identifiers were discovered from the texts of the relevant papers and interviews conducted with 19 experts in the area of BI and Cloud computing. The main factors of our research include drivers, enablers, competencies, critical success factors, SME characteristics and adoption. The subfactors of included competitors pressure, decision-making time, data access, data analysis and calculations, budget, clear view, clear missions, BI tools, data infrastructure, information merging, business key sector, data owner, business process, data resource, data quality, IT skill, organizational preparedness, innovation orientation, SME characteristics, SME activity, SME structure, BI maturity, standardization, agility, balances between BI systems and business strategies. Then, the quantitative part continued with the fuzzy Delphi technique in which two factors, decision-making time and agility, were deleted in the first round, and the second round was conducted for the rest of the factors. In that step, 24 factors were assessed based on the opinions of 19 experts. In the second round, none of the factors were removed, and thus the Delphi analysis was concluded. Next, data analysis was carried out by building the structural self-interaction matrix to present the model. According to the results, adoptability is a first-level or dependent variable. Regarding the results of interpretive structural modeling (ISM), the variable of critical success factors is a second-level variable. Enablers, competencies and SME characteristics are the third-level and most effective variables of the model. Accordingly, the initial model of Cloud BI for SMEs is presented as follows: The results of ISM revealed the impact of SME characteristics on BI critical success factors and adoptability. Since this category was not an underlying category of BI; thus, it played the role of a moderating variable for the impact of critical success factors on adoptability in the final model. Research limitations/implications: Since this study is limited to about 100 SMEs in the north of Iran, results should be applied cautiously to SMEs in other countries. Generalizing the study's results to other industries and geographic regions should be done with care since management perceptions, and financial condition of a business vary significantly. Additionally, the topic of business intelligence in SMEs constrained the sample from the start since not all SMEs use business intelligence systems, and others are unaware of their advantages. BI tools enable the effective management of companies of all sizes by providing analytic data and critical performance indicators. In general, SMEs used fewer business intelligence technologies than big companies. According to studies, SMEs understand the value of simplifying their information resources to make critical business choices. Additionally, they are aware of the market's abundance of business intelligence products. However, many SMEs lack the technical knowledge necessary to choose the optimal tool combination. In light of the frequently significant investment required to implement BI approaches, a viable alternative for SMEs may be to adopt cloud computing solutions that enable organizations to strengthen their systems and information technologies on a pay-per-use basis while also providing access to cutting-edge BI technologies at a reasonable price. Practical implications: Before the implementation of Cloud BI in SMEs, condition of driver, competency and critical success factor of SMEs should also be considered. These will help to define the significant resources and skills that form the strategic edge and lead to the success of Cloud BI projects. Originality/value: Most of the previous studies have been focused on factors such as critical success factors in cloud business intelligence and cloud computing in small and medium-sized enterprises, cloud business intelligence adoption models, the services used in cloud business intelligence, the factors involved in acceptance of cloud business intelligence, the challenges and advantages of cloud business intelligence, and drivers and barriers to cloud business intelligence. None of the studied resources proposed any comprehensive model for designing and implementing cloud business intelligence in small and medium-sized enterprises; they only investigated some of the aspects of this issue. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Since the 18th CPC National Congress, the concept of green and innovative development has become the guiding ideology to guide the transformation of the whole macroeconomic structure and the innovation and development of micro enterprises. Accordingly, green innovation has also become an important innovation direction of micro enterprises. In essence, green innovation is to give play to the innovation attribute and social environment attribute of enterprise technological innovation and realize the effective integration of economic efficiency orientation and social environment orientation. At the level of innovation orientation, process and output, it not only focuses on the economic effect or economic value under the market logic, but also focuses on the positive impact of innovation on the environment, including resource consumption, resource allocation efficiency Positive externalities and spillovers of knowledge and positive environmental effects on natural environmental pollution emissions. Especially in the high-quality development stage, the value of ecological civilization construction in the whole modernization construction is prominent. Realizing the green technology innovation system guided by sustainable social and environmental value creation and driving China to achieve scientific and technological selfreliance and self-improvement is the key choice to build a socialist modern innovation power. In recent years, scholars have carried out a lot of research around the policy system of green innovation, the driving factors of green innovation and the value effect of green innovation. The existing research on the transmission driving effect of the legitimacy pressure of stakeholders outside the government on enterprise green innovation and transformation, and the research samples for enterprise green technology innovation are also concentrated in small samples. There is a large deviation in the measurement and estimation results of enterprise green technology innovation. Based on the above research gaps, this paper takes China′s A-share listed companies from 2010 to 2019 as the empirical research sample, empirically analyzes the actual impact and internal mechanism of media attention on enterprise green technology innovation based on OLS estimation method, and analyzes the heterogeneous impact of different media attention types (policy media and marketoriented media) on enterprise green technology innovation from the perspective of legitimacy, It further analyzes the regulatory effect of environmental policy uncertainty in media attention and enterprise green technology innovation. The research contribution of this paper lies in: at the theoretical level, on the one hand, based on large sample data, this paper comprehensively investigates the impact of media attention on enterprise green innovation performance, enriches the measurement of enterprise green innovation performance and avoids the bias of estimation results caused by too narrow samples, and investigates the specific effects of different types of media attention heterogeneity legitimacy on enterprise green technology innovation, It expands the current research on the factors driving enterprise green technology innovation based on external environmental regulation. Secondly, from the perspective of corporate social responsibility, the transmission framework of “external legitimacy pressure-corporate green technology innovation” is built, which provides basic empirical evidence for confirming the green sustainable orientation driven by media attention and strengthening the stakeholder network and social support effect of corporate green technology innovation based on corporate social responsibility. The results show that: first, media attention has a significant promoting effect on enterprise green technology innovation, which has a significant positive driving effect on enterprise green patent application and green patent authorization; Distinguishing media types, whether policy oriented media or market-oriented media, has a significant promoting effect on enterprise green technology innovation; Second, the mechanism test shows that media attention promotes corporate green technology innovation by strengthening corporate social responsibility, that is, corporate social responsibility has a significant intermediary effect between media attention and corporate green technology innovation, and subdivides the content dimension of corporate social responsibility. Corporate environmental responsibility has a significant intermediary effect between media attention and corporate green technology innovation; The regulatory effect test results show that environmental policy uncertainty strengthens the orientation of enterprise green innovation, and produces a significant positive regulatory effect between media attention and enterprise green technology innovation, indicating that environmental policy uncertainty in transition countries helps to strengthen the risk seeking attribute of enterprise green innovation. Third, the results of heterogeneity analysis show that media attention drives enterprise green technology innovation is more obvious in large-scale enterprises, mandatory disclosure environment and areas with weaker marketization environment. Based on the above research, this paper has three management and policy implications. First, give full play to the external governance effect and institutional legitimacy transmission effect of media on enterprise green innovation, and optimize enterprise green technology innovation orientation and technology innovation performance based on stakeholder pressure mechanism and signal mechanism. And different types of media have different types of attention. Therefore, for negative corporate social responsibility practices or negative environmental problems derived from enterprises, it is necessary to strengthen the pressure driving mechanism of the regulatory legitimacy of official media, For the positive practice of corporate social responsibility, we need to rely more on the normative legitimacy and signal mechanism under the market incentive to realize the sustainable incentive mechanism construction of enterprise green technology innovation. Second, enterprises need to attach great importance to their own sustainable concept and sustainable value creation, and based on the design of long-term oriented incentive system, promote the better embedding of corporate social responsibility into the enterprise′s technological innovation process and business model innovation, so as to realize the effective integration of green technology innovation strategic orientation and sustainable business model into the enterprise innovation system, Finally, promote the symbiotic development of enterprises and stakeholders. Third, environmental protection supervision and policymaking departments need to formulate environmental policies for the region according to time and place, avoid the pressure of enterprise green transformation and upgrading caused by excessive enterprise uncertainty, and maintain the dynamic balance between short-term operation pressure and long-term transformation. © 2023, Journal of Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management.

	abstract = {Since 2015, the approval of the 2030 Agenda and of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has led to a notable reshaping and expansion of the architecture of the international cooperation system. The SDGs mark a new path for the planning processes of the different actors working for development, expanding their goals, proposing an update of the roles they must play, and defining new frameworks for relationships and spaces for action. Non-governmental development organizations (NGDOs), whose traditional mission focused on reducing the poverty gap, defending human rights, or promoting environmental protection, must be able to respond satisfactorily to these new challenges, pass beyond their classic positions, and adapt to an increasingly complex and turbulent global context. Achieving high impact in the SDGs requires development organizations to be more agile and innovative. With the intention of bringing visibility to the importance that innovation can play in the success and results achieved by development cooperation organizations, the main objective of this study was to validate, through a sample of Spanish NGDOs, a causal model that represents the positive contribution which innovation orientation generates in the result of the activity of these entities. This research concludes by confirming that innovation orientation favors the attainment of a higher degree of success in the projects and actions carried out by non-profit entities which promote the SDGs, which has a direct and positive impact on the performance they achieve.

	abstract = {Purpose: The unprecedented changes in the marketplace induced by the COVID-19 pandemic and the resultant accelerated corporate migration to virtual ecosystems have added several unique research opportunities and theoretical gaps, especially in business-to-business (B2B) small- and medium-sized enterprises (SME) markets in the service sector. Particularly, customer interactions in B2B services that were once sustained by the “people mix” now demand a huge overhaul in light of the “new normal” restrictions. Hence, the purpose of this study is to explore how B2B service firms can engender firm value through virtual customer interactions during and in the post-COVID-19 era from an SME’s perspective. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopts an exploratory qualitative inquiry to contribute to this discourse by proposing a conceptual framework based on prior literature and relevant theoretical frameworks, as well as qualitative interviews with SME managers, CEOs and/or owner-managers. Findings: The qualitative findings reveal organizational preparedness, empathy, digital content and trust as key enablers of effective B2B virtual interaction that enhances cocreated value, thereby augmenting firm value. This study offers a much-needed examination of virtual interaction in B2B contexts and proposes a business customer virtual interaction model. Research limitations/implications: The exploratory nature of this study is one limitation, and future studies with a bigger representative sample size that uses survey or experimental data drawn from large enterprises might add value to the current findings. Also, while this study is conducted in dynamic markets due to the COVID-19 crisis, future research must examine the customer/firm’s experiences in other forms of crises-led market ecosystems. Practical implications: B2B service firms must be strongly inclined to continuously take steps to develop and maintain virtual interaction with customers. Proactive efforts to familiarize internal and external stakeholders with virtual interaction platforms are a crucial step for effective customer engagement. The effectiveness of B2B virtual interactions can be strengthened through digital content that elicits trust and exhibits empathy, especially in crises led-markets. Also, the value created for the firm must be redeployed strategically to sustain positive customer engagement behaviors that continue to deliver value to the firm and the customer. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the increasing B2B customer engagement literature by exploring the ongoing dialogue on how B2B firms can strive and succeed in the post-COVID-19 era or related crises-led market ecosystems through enhanced virtual B2B customer interaction efforts. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Drawing upon upper echelon, regulatory focus and attention theories and focusing on SMEs, the purpose of this paper is to answer questions on how the motivational disposition (promotion vs. prevention regulatory focus) of CEOs affects their information search patterns (i.e. search selection and intensity) and consequently organizational level engagement in different types of innovation activities (exploration vs. exploitation). Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative study was conducted collecting data from the CEOs of SMEs operating in the dynamic wine and spirits industry in Greece. The data were collected in two independent time streams and the proposed theoretical model was tested by applying OLS regression analysis. Findings: The current research provides evidence that differences in CEOs’ level of promotion and prevention focus trigger different information search selection and search intensity patterns. Nonetheless, the attention to innovation components act as mediators only in the hypothesized relationships between a CEO's level of prevention and promotion focus and exploration. Paradoxically, filtered through attention to innovation and triggered from the same motive, that is to reduce negative emotions, promotion focus CEOs choose to direct resources to exploitation and avoid investing in exploration, whilst the opposite was supported for prevention focus CEOs. Practical implications: The results highlight the important role of a CEO's regulatory focus orientation in promoting diverse attention to innovation patterns and firm-level innovation tendencies towards exploration and/or exploitation. Originality/value: This study's contributions extend and combine the theories of regulatory focus, UET and attention in the field of managerial/entrepreneurship behavior and innovation. Therefore, they are valuable for understanding the determinants of firm-level innovation choices (exploration vs. exploitation) in SMEs. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the influence of ascribed and achieved political connections on corporate strategies of incremental versus radical innovation. The corporate political strategy literature maintains that while politically connected firms have access to resources controlled by the government, they also have an obligation to reciprocate for this access by fulfilling government expectations. We integrate an institutional perspective with the political strategy literature to develop the argument that ascribed political connections enhance incremental innovation because firms with these connections will tend to innovate just enough to meet government expectations. In contrast, firms with achieved political connections will tend to prefer radical innovation because these innovations help them to maintain their relationships with the government and expand their competitive advantage in the market. Furthermore, we propose that these effects depend on firms' innovation orientation, captured by the firms' technological capability, industry characteristics, and the innovation context of their geographical region. Our predictions are largely supported by analysis of a panel dataset of privately controlled, publicly listed Chinese firms during the period 2008 to 2018. Our findings reveal that the positive effect of ascribed political connections on incremental innovation is less salient when a firm has stronger technological capability, or when a firm operates in a high-tech industry or a region with a strong innovative climate. Conversely, the positive influence of achieved political connections on radical innovation is stronger when a firm has stronger technological capability, or when a firm competes in a high-tech industry or is located in a region with a strong innovative climate. We also discuss the important implications for firms and the government. © 2023 Product Development & Management Association.},

This study, rooted in a comprehensive evaluation of dynamic capabilities and innovation orientation, introduces a framework that could serve as a valuable resource for subsequent research. It contributes to the global discourse on optimizing digital supply chain practices among SMEs. Quantitative method was employed, gathering data from 212 professionals in SMEs in Dubai, UAE, via an online questionnaire. The collected data were analyzed using SmartPLS 4, focusing on reliability, validity, discriminant validity, and hypothesis testing. The findings show a significant influence of innovation orientation on the digital supply chain. Dynamic capabilities also exhibit an indirect yet substantial impact on the relationship between innovation orientation and the digital supply chain. The identified dynamic capabilities are instrumental in refining decisions associated with the circular economy and leveraging technology to enhance supply chain mechanisms. These capabilities foster positive correlations between the digital supply chain and innovation. The predominant advantage of digital supply chains for consumers lies in their agility and speed, facilitating swift response to customer demand and bolstering business efficiency. The model presented is a template for future research, which could expand its scope to include other industries like manufacturing or services, augmenting the robustness of the findings. © 2024 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.},

This study divides the fuzzy front-end (FFE) activities of new product development (NPD) projects into idea generation, concept definition, and initial planning and investigates the transmission path between innovation orientation and competitive advantage through these three activities. Additionally, we explore the moderating role of internal competition. This empirical study is based on 261 respondents from China. The results suggest that innovation orientation has a positive impact on FFE activities, and these promote competitive advantage. The mediating role of FFE activities in the relationship between innovation orientation and competitive advantage is confirmed. The results also reveal that internal competition regulates the relationship between innovation orientation and FFE activities in an inverted U-shape. The study further reveals the internal mechanism of innovation orientation on competitive advantage and provides a deeper understanding of the link between them.

Therefore, this study draws on the valuable theoretical underpinnings of the resource-based view and information processing theory to examine the mechanism through which an organization's innovation orientation (IO) and team unlearning (TU) can impact new product development (NPD) success. Design/methodology/approach: A causal model was developed in order to analyze the role of innovation orientation and team unlearning on NPD success. This proposed model and several hypotheses were gauged using data from 255 NPD team members from Taiwanese high-tech and traditional companies. Findings: The results indicate that both IO and TU relate to outcomes. Specifically, this study demonstrates that it is insufficient that firms simply establish the configurations needed to enhance their IO and TU, firms also need to find out the correct mechanism to enhance NPD success. The relationships between IO, TU and NPD success were fully mediated by team information processing. Originality/value: This report sheds light on the importance of innovation orientation and team unlearning in today's NPD process and uncovers the underlying mechanism through which IO and TU contribute to NPD success. It also offers precise advice for the assessment of management of team information-processing to boost the performance of new products. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

With no or very few studies investigating employee learning and development adaptation in SMEs, we address an important research gap. Research Design & Methods: We tested the hypothesized relationships on a sample of 214 Polish SMEs. Data was collected using the computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) method. The logit model and ordered probit model were employed to analyse the data. Findings: While the results clearly indicate that innovation orientation had an impact on the adaptation of training and development for Polish SMEs during the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, internationalization did not exhibit any significant impact on the number of training sessions conducted during the first year of Covid-19. However, the existence of prior experience with online technologies may have moderated the relationship between internationalization and adaptation of learning and development. Implications & Recommendations: To become quick adapters, SMEs should develop an innovation orienta-tion, implement online learning practices and foster mutual learning within the organization, and take every opportunity to learn from external partners. Contribution & Value Added: With this study, we contribute to the body of knowledge investigating SME adaptation during Covid-19. This research implies that innovation orientation can positively influence how firms adapt their training and development in times of crisis. This pioneering contribution is an important piece of the puzzle of what might determine the competitive advantage of some SMEs over others in years to come. © 2023, Cracow University of Economics.

The authors aim to answer the following simple yet important questions: how do SMEs with market orientation (MO) and those with entrepreneurial orientation (EO) differ in terms of innovation performance? Do MO and EO have conflicting effects on the process of innovation at SMEs? If so, how does this conflict affect the innovation performance of SMEs? Design/methodology/approach: This study explores the effects of MO and EO on different types of technological innovation among SMEs using data collected from 124 INNOBIZ-certified manufacturing SMEs in South Korea. Logistic regression analysis and moderated regression analysis were conducted to test the hypotheses. Findings: The empirical results demonstrate that MO and EO engender different kinds of technological innovations. MO stimulates “new-to-the-firm” product innovation, while EO drives “new-to-the-industry” innovation in processes and products. Furthermore, SMEs' overall innovation performance will suffer from the conflicting interplay between MO and EO. Originality/value: The findings of this study encourage SMEs to concentrate SMEs' resources and learning efforts on one specific innovation orientation and only then to develop SMEs' ambidextrous managerial capabilities. This study offers academic contributions in that the study overcomes the limitations of past studies on the strategic orientation of SMEs by empirically confirming the dilemmas faced by SMEs and expands the theoretical understanding of the relationship between MO and EO. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

In addition, studies of the impact of changes in strategic aspects as BGs mature on BG performance and survival have yielded conflicting results. To address this gap in knowledge, the present study examines the relationships between intelligence generation and innovation orientation, and branding strategies as moderated by maturity. The data were received from 133 senior managers of BGs of various ages. The analysis shows that BG maturity negatively moderates the relationship between intelligence generation and functional branding strategy but does not influence the relationships of innovation orientation with branding strategies. Furthermore, emotional branding showed stable association with both financial and market performance indicators. This study demonstrates that maturity affects the orientations and performance of BGs and calls for a reassessment of the competitive international strategy of BGs at the post-entry stage. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {The current global trend in sustainable business practices is to optimize green innovation performance. To protect the environment and maintain their own survival, organizations must strengthen their green innovation capabilities. Drawing on the recourse-based view and ecology modernization theory (EMT), this study examines the direct effect of green strategic orientations, green entrepreneurial orientation, green market orientation, green innovation orientation, and green organizational culture on the firm’s green innovation capability, as well as the mediating effect of green innovation capability on the relationship of these four factors and green innovation performance. Besides, this study also explored the moderating effects of green management system implementation and firm size on the association between green innovation capability and green innovation performance. To test the hypothesized model, a questionnaire survey was administered to gather responses from 293 medium-sized and large manufacturing firms operating in Pakistan. The partial least squares method was used for data analysis. The results revealed that green entrepreneurial orientation, green market orientation, green innovation orientation, and green organizational culture positively impacted green innovation capability, which subsequently positively influenced green innovation performance. Moreover, effective implementation of green management systems can bolster the effect of green innovation capability on green innovation performance, and the mediating effect of green innovation capability has also been confirmed. These indicated that the management of medium and large manufacturing firms operating in Pakistan should focus on encouraging green innovation and training employees regarding the latest eco-friendly technologies to attain performance and sustainable development goals. Policymakers should implement green business development programs and offer rewards or penalties for promoting compliance. The present study contributes greatly to the literature by applying EMT as an alternative to address the mediating role of green innovation capability and the moderating effect of green management system implementation in enhancing firms’ green innovation performance. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

To fill this important gap, our study adopts a configurational approach contending that a specific set of drivers makeup the profiles of exporting SMEs. Using the Classification and Regression Trees (CART) algorithm, we empirically show three distinctive exporting profiles for product, service, and process innovators, with varying magnitude and importance of export drivers. Our results show the most important export drivers for product, service and process innovators. While process innovators’ profile excludes process innovation, product and service innovators’ profiles include product and service innovation respectively.

In practice, a new sustainable entrepreneurial model called “digital sustainable entrepreneurship” (DSE) has emerged. Aiming to establish a DSE model based on digital capability (DC) and digital innovation orientation (DIO), this study explored what kind of digital capability could be built to lead to a boost in digital sustainable entrepreneurship, to realize the creation of social and environmental value. We also revealed how DC affected DSE by introducing DIO and discussed the moderating role played therein by the manager’s cognition of sustainable opportunities (MCSO). The study adopted CFA and SEM on the model using AMOS 27.0 and used the multiple regression analysis method to conduct an empirical study into the data from 308 SMEs in pollutive industries to validate the research framework. The results show a positive relationship between DC and DSE; DC is positively correlated to DIO; DIO is positively correlated to DSE; DIO plays a partial mediating role between DC and DSE; and MCSO positively moderates the relationship among DC, DIO, and DSE. This study will be of practical significance regarding how sustainable entrepreneurs can boost digital sustainable entrepreneurship. © 2022 by the authors.},

Two hypotheses were set for verification: “There are a certain number of Japanese farmers who belong to the creative class” (H1) and "The creative class is highly entrepreneurial, appreciates the attractiveness of agriculture, prefers sustainability policies and seeks to create shared value in agriculture" (H2). We obtained analytical results as follows. First, from the results of the latent class analysis (LCA), farmers were classified into four classes (class 1: Majority, class 2: Early adopter, class 3: Laggard, class 4: Innovator). In addition, Class 4 (innovator) was interpreted as the creative class because most respondents answered positively about creative thinking, job satisfaction, life satisfaction, innovation orientation, social capital and cognitive changes due to the COVID-19 epidemic. Second, the analysis of the structural equation modeling (SEM) revealed the factors affected the entrepreneurship, namely preference for agricultural policy and impact on creating shared value in agriculture in the creative class. In other words, we found that the evaluation of the multi-functionality of agriculture influences each element for entrepreneurship of the creative class, and also influences the preference for agricultural policy and creation of shared value. Thirdly, analysis of cognitive maps revealed that creative classes contribute to sustainable agricultural and rural development through the creation of shared value. However, in current Japan, the creative classes are concentrated in urban areas and farmers highly value the risk of failure, so there is no virtuous cycle for the entrepreneurial environment to shape entrepreneurial attitudes. Therefore, it is important for policies to develop creative classes in flatland agricultural areas and mountainous areas, and build networks for the creative classes among different regions. © 2023, The Japan Section of the Regional Science Association International.},

Precisely, the objective of the paper is to test whether the use of social media platforms positively influences ambidextrous innovation orientation in fashion companies. Design/methodology/approach: Empirical quantitative research was carried out on a sample of 853 small- to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) operating in the fashion industry in Italy. Using a logistic regression methodology, four hypotheses were tested to verify the correlation of four dimensions of social media platforms with an ambidextrous innovation orientation among fashion firms. Findings: The four hypotheses were validated: the structural dimension, the relational behaviour dimension, the cognitive dimension and knowledge transfer practices of social media platforms were proven to positively influence ambidextrous innovation orientation in fashion firms. Research limitations/implications: Though this is one of the few research studies that offers a quantitative analysis in this field, it could be further developed, for instance by extending the sample of firms to SMEs operating in other countries or by comparing multinationals with SMEs. Originality/value: This paper provides an original contribution to studies on the use of social media to promote ambidexterity in firms, which has only been studied to a limited extent in the extant literature.

	abstract = {While many studies on social media from users' perspectives have been conducted, less attention has been paid to the effect of social media on organizations' performance, particularly among hotels. The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of social media on hotels' business performance in the Lebanese hotel sector. In this study, a structural equation modelling method has been used for data analysis. The survey data was gathered from a sample of 146 hotels in Lebanon. Data analysis results demonstrate the positive and significant relationship between social media characteristics (visibility and association but not editability) on hotels' business performance. The findings present valuable implications for hotel managers to direct their social media strategy and to capitalize on the possible benefits of social media to increase the business performance of hotels. In addition, the findings could also provide useful insights into other business sectors that have an intention to invest in social media. Copyright © 2019, IGI Global.},

The study analyzed how entrepreneurial orientation (EO) lead to innovative orientation among MSMEs in Region III outside of the variables included in the 2014 GEM database. To supplement the dichotomous nature of the 2014 GEM data where no probing questions were deployed to elaborate on their responses, the sequential explanatory mixed method design was used to validate the quantitative data generated from the 2014 GEM respondents from Region III. The quantitative design used the 170 respondents from Region 3 while the qualitative design collected data via focus group discussion (FGD) from 25 nascent, new and established entrepreneurs from Region III. The quantitative data was analyzed using multinomial logistic regression due to the dichotomous and interval nature of the GEM data. The qualitative data from the FGD was examined using content analysis in establishing general themes generated. Results of the study yielded competitive aggressiveness as a significant determinant of innovative orientation which the FGD participants validated and deemed to be as relevant as the other EO constructs of innovativeness, autonomy, risk-taking and proactiveness.                          © 2019 by De La Salle University.},

It also aims at exploring the effects of soft and hard LM on innovation performance. Design/methodology/approach: The study analyzes survey data collected as a part of a high-performance manufacturing (HPM) project from 238 international manufacturing companies in eight countries and three industries. Exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were applied to assess construct validity. The study hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling. Findings: The results demonstrated that innovation-oriented companies tend to adopt aspects of both soft and hard LM. However, the results revealed an insignificant effect of soft and hard LM on innovation performance. The study also showed that innovation performance is positively influenced by an IO. These results indicate that having an IO is vital for enhancing both LM as well as innovation performance. They also evidently suggest that LM is more related to continuous improvement (incremental innovation) rather than (radical) innovation and, as such, is not important for firm’s intent on enhancing their innovation performance. Practical implications: The current study demonstrates that IO and LM are complementary and not contradicting strategies. The two strategies share many cultural aspects, similarities and commonalities. However, LM is not sufficient to predict innovation performance. Managers of the surveyed manufacturing firms are advised to focus on IO, as it has beneficial impacts on both LM (continuous improvement initiatives) as well as innovation performance. This clearly indicates that placing the emphasis upon radical (innovative) improvement rather than incremental improvement (LM practices) is believed to support continuous and innovative improvement alike. Originality/value: The relationship between LM and innovation is debated in the existing literature, but the debate is characterized by a lack of empirical evidence. This is one of the first studies that empirically investigates the relationships between IO, LM and innovation performance. It identifies some new insights to direct future research, particularly regarding different innovation types as well as in service organizations. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Although software patents have been growing steadily since 1996, when the restrictions on the patentability of software were eliminated, their value and impacts on the firm’s profits remain unclear and ambiguous. Drawing on the real options theory and the literature on exploration and exploitation, we develop a novel theoretical framework to assess the value of software patents. Moreover, we examine the impact of contextual factors related to the nature of innovation underlying firms’ patent portfolios (exploitative versus explorative) and the environmental uncertainty (competitiveness and dynamism) on the value of software patents. Specifically, we examine the interaction effect of a firm’s software patent stock and its innovation orientation on firm value in markets exhibiting different levels of environmental uncertainty. Based on a large-panel data set consisting of 602 U.S. firms, our results indicate that a software patent portfolio having higher levels of explorative orientation is associated with a higher firm value (as measured by Tobin’s q) in environments exhibiting low dynamism and high competitiveness. By contrast, a software patent portfolio with higher levels of exploitative orientation is associated with a higher firm value in environments with high dynamism and low competitiveness. We discuss the implications for research and practice. Copyright: © 2019 INFORMS},

Introducing environmental policy instruments to stimulate green innovation is key to mitigating global warming. We propose a carbon tax design with a typical green innovation orientation that links carbon taxes with the low-carbon technology (LCT) of enterprises and imposes a progressive tax on heterogeneous enterprises with LCT stock to encourage green innovation. This study used a dynamic evolution game model based on the Stackelberg model of heterogeneous enterprises with LCT stock to analyze the green-innovation-inducing effect of unit progressive carbon taxes. A unit progressive carbon tax could encourage enterprises to participate in green innovation, regardless of their initial green innovation willingness. The progressive tax rate was more effective than a fixed rate for stimulating green innovation by all enterprises. There was a marginal diminishing effect of increases in the tax rate. An increase in the innovation cost coefficient of enterprises reduced the green-innovation-inducing effect of the unit progressive carbon tax. Increasing the tax rate was effective only under normal circumstances. A decline in the carbon reduction in enterprises also reduced the green-innovation-inducing effect of the unit progressive carbon tax. Furthermore, increasing the tax rate when the carbon reduction amount was extremely low caused enterprises to abandon green innovation. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Crucial to a more sustainable economy is the successful implementation of sustainable practices through entrepreneurial activities. Although there are attempts to describe how sustainable entrepreneurs differentiate themselves, the question of how some entrepreneurs manage to successfully create a sustainable enterprise, while others do not, remains unanswered. The aim of this research is to find causal patterns that explain the success of sustainable entrepreneurs, using their social performance as a measure. Using a configuration approach-based fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) of 598 Austrian small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), we could identify four different combinations of the interconnected variables of innovation orientation, environmental sustainability, resource leveraging and achievement motivation, which all lead to social performance depending on the respective networking intensity of the firms. The only variable that is included in all combinations is environmental sustainability, thus indicating it may be either crucial to or a prerequisite for achieving social performance in SMEs. © 2017 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The main objective of this paper is to investigate the phenomenon of firm heterogeneity among entrepreneurs who started their business with a similar initial endowment. The information collected for analysis came from a unique sample of 105 small farmers, who were settlers of an agrarian reform project in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. These farmers were granted similar resources (plot of land, housing, and capital) in the 1980s. About thirty years later, they were observed to have different performances in terms of production value. This article provides a test of explanatory variables for their differing performance, under the lens of strategic orientation. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) was used to obtain economic efficiency scores as proxies for performance. These scores were used in a second-stage Tobit regression model, in which the effects of three strategic orientations (profit orientation, social network orientation, and innovation orientation) on farms’ efficiency were tested. The results revealed that efficiency scores ranged from 0.02 and to 1, with a mean of 0.646 and standard deviation of 0.29, showing that the economic performance among beneficiaries is heterogeneous. In the Tobit model, the parameter for “profit orientation” was significant to explain performance differentials, while the parameters for the other strategic orientations were not. Parameters for control variables “off-farm income”, “access to rural credit”, and “access to government price policy” were also significant. These results are relevant to the theoretical debate on heterogeneity, as well as to the design of land reform policies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Innovation is a key source of organizational growth and profitability. Many organizations at the front end of innovation struggle to engender an innovation approach that is effective and lasting. This article presents a framework that defines the interdependency of innovation and strategy, and then outlines the role of top management to continuously renew the positioning of the firm. Based on a synthesis of prior research—including the Dynamic Capabilities View, Innovation Orientation, and Disruptive Innovation Theory—and our own experience working with organizations, we present an operational strategy shift framework, which allows practitioners to increase, refine, and transform their firm's capability to innovate (CTI) toward achieving their strategic objectives. This framework provides guidance that leaders can use to integrate innovation into their strategic process. © 2018 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University},

Using a large multi-country sample, the analysis involved a structural equation model of seven organisational factors associated with the management of innovation, and their relationship with the anticipated volume of sales, profitability and lifecycle of the innovation. Significant relationships were found between the possession of an innovation strategy and formal commercialisation management, and optimism over sales volumes and lifecycle. The study provides new insights into the resource-based view and theory of entrepreneurial rents, strengthening SME owner-managers' assessment on future investments in innovation and how to utilise their best capabilities. Policy makers also gain more insights into the commercialisation process within SMEs to foster the innovation orientation in both high and low tech sectors. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.},

This study adopted a cross-sectional design and collected quantitative data using self-reported adopted scales from 213 randomly selected Batik SMEs from Kelantan and Terengganu, Malaysia. The results revealed that INO, CSO, and ABC had a positive and significant effect on the economic sustainability (ECS) of the Batik SMEs in Malaysia. The effects of SPO and NWO on ECS were positive but not statistically significant. It was found that ECS significantly and positively affected the environmental sustainability (ENS) of the Batik SMEs in Malaysia. Besides that, ECS mediated the effects of CSO and ABC on the ENS of the Batik SMEs in Malaysia. Furthermore, important performance matrix analysis revealed that the most important factors for ENS were Batik SMEs’ ECS, absorptive capacity, and INO. For the performance of ENS, the most important factors were CSO, SPO, and NWO. The Batik SMEs and entrepreneurial development programs and policies should focus on innovation and CSO as well as improving ABC to sustain in today’s competitive business environment. © 2020 by the authors.

The purpose of this paper is to revisit the concept innovation orientation in the light of recent research. Design/methodology/approach: This paper presents a systematic review of this literature, covering 74 scholarly articles published between 1982 and 2017. Findings: Innovation orientation is a sub-construct positioned within the wider field of innovation and relates to an innovation-based strategic orientation, where orientation is used to describe the overall dominant approach that represents an organisation’s competitive posture and strategic focus. It is a multifaceted construct that includes a range of core common variables innovation culture, competition-based understanding, organisational flexibility and specific capital and knowledge capabilities and is particular relevant for that managers and executives to understand how to manage innovation at the firm level. Literature also reports links between innovation orientation and organisational performance. Originality/value: On the basis of these analyses, a comprehensive innovation orientation framework is developed including key antecedents and key outcomes in terms of performance enhancement and capabilities development.

	abstract = {While scholarship on public leadership has recently gained momentum in public administration, it is unclear how researchers should account for the "public"in public leadership. We shed new light on this issue by introducing the approach of Implicit Leadership Theories (ILTs) to the field of public administration. This socio-cognitive approach suggests that people's everyday, rather than scholarly, theories about the characteristics of leaders provide important explanations of how they respond to leadership situations. We investigate whether people hold Implicit Public Leadership Theories (IPLTs) and explore how these images of public leaders contrast with generic ILTs. We extract these taxonomies from data gathered in a survey experiment in Germany (N = 1,072). Results show that IPLTs have overlaps with generic ILTs but are unique in terms of rule abidance and innovation-orientation. In contrast, charismatic aspects of leadership only figure in generic ILTs. The structure of ILTs, both generic and public, is surprisingly stable across the subsamples of public and non-public employees. We discuss how the findings may assist public management scholars in the development of explicit theories of public leadership and derive a research agenda based on a socio-cognitive approach.  © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

Entrepreneurship is promoted as one of the most important approaches to achieving civilization and urbanization. However, few studies have systematically examined the influencing factors of landless peasants' entrepreneurial intention (EI). This research gap presents barriers for making effective policies to promote entrepreneurship among landless peasants. This study aims to examine the critical factors influencing the EI of landless peasants and their interrelationships. The critical factors of landless peasants' EI are identified using logistic regression analysis. The logical and structural relationships among critical factors are mined by interpretative structural modeling. A chain of factors with an interrelated and clear hierarchy is built to clarify the explanatory structure of landless peasants' EI. The results show that the EI of landless peasants is significantly influenced by five factors: gender, achievement motivation, innovation orientation, land expropriation scenario, and entrepreneurial experience. Entrepreneurial experience is a direct surface factor; innovation orientation is an indirect intermediate layer factor; and gender, achievement motivation, and land expropriation scenario are deeply rooted factors. The results provide a good reference for formulating effective entrepreneurship policies to address landless peasants' employment and sustainable livelihoods. © 2017 by the authors.},

Using a sample of 638 SMEs in four industry clusters in Tianjin, China, we confirm an inverted U-shaped correlation between a firm's relative innovation orientation and performance, and explicate the latent mechanisms underlying such an inverted U shape. We find that the number and strength of a firm's cluster relationships can moderate this inverted U-shaped curve: the former moves the turning point of the inverted U shape toward exploratory orientation, and the latter moves the turning point toward exploitative orientation. For improved performance, we discuss appropriate innovation balancing strategies for cluster firms with different cluster relationships, and optimal cluster strategies under different innovation-balancing conditions. This study adds to the increasing scholarly effort on latent mechanisms behind U-shaped relationships and moderating effects on such relationships in management research.

	abstract = {Purpose: Much of the scholarly works on open innovation have significantly highlighted the application of the model in high-tech industries in the developed world. However, how the phenomenon applies in low-tech small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in developing countries is still marginal and lacks substantive research. This study aims to draw on the network theory of innovation to examine the open innovation orientations of low-tech SMEs in an emerging market context, particularly Ghana. Design/methodology/approach: The research design used was a qualitative–quantitative approach: the qualitative phase of the study, involving 31 low-tech SMEs, used a multiple case approach through semi-structured interviews and analyzed the interview responses using NVivo statistical tool; the quantitative phase, including 706 low-tech SMEs, also used a survey questionnaire approach and descriptively analyzed data collected using SPSS statistical tool. Findings: Results disclose that the low-tech SMEs’ employment of the open innovation model are preponderantly driven by commercialization purposes, knowledge acquisition motives, financial motives and strategic motives, whereas their open innovation approaches include inbound strategies (collaboration with suppliers, co-creation/customer immersion), outbound strategies (IP licensing out) and coupled strategies (strategic alliances, contract manufacturing, and joint ventures). Moreover, the findings show that the SMEs’ preferred open innovation partners include suppliers, customers, private universities and non-industry, in that order. Finally, results show that the low-tech SMEs’ open innovation advantages include market gains, strategic gains, knowledge gains, operational gains, financial gains and network gains, whereas their open innovation challenges colossally were collaboration barriers and organizational barriers. Practical implications: These findings purvey valuable perceptiveness for managers, academicians and policymakers alike; they highlight the importance of open innovation to low-tech SMEs, proven strategies, challenges involved and the mechanisms for effective and efficient adoption of the open innovation model. Originality/value: The value of this study reclines in the extension of open innovation research from high-tech industries in the advanced world to low-tech SMEs in emerging economies. Results of the study enrich the knowledge and understanding of how the theoretical model of open innovation is adopted and implemented by the low-tech SME sector in emerging economies. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

A comparative case study approach using fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) is applied to systematically compare e-service availability in the former 28 EU member states. Findings: Three configurations of sufficient conditions are identified: government capacity in conjunction with either bureaucratic human resource practices, centralized state structure or managerial innovation orientation. Three country clusters are derived: effective bureaucrats, effective centralists and effective managers.

	abstract = {Abstract: Small and medium enterprises cannot achieve environmental sustainability goals in isolation. They need to acquire capabilities to perform within networks of professional and social relations with other organizations. However, network relationships are often insufficient due to lack of sustainability in network capability. This multidimensional concept involves four components: coordination, relational skills, partner knowledge, and internal communication. This study proposes a new dimension related to the collaborative environmental relationship. This component addresses an enterprise’s ability to enhance environmental collaboration, share knowledge, and increase environmental awareness. This study, therefore, suggests testing and comparing the five-dimensional scale of network capability with the existing four-dimensional scale, and examining its impact on eco-innovation capability and sustainable performance. This has not been tested previously. Using partial least squares path modelling, this study tests a set of hypothesised relationships that focus on a sample of 237 Tunisian enterprises. The findings reveal that: (1) the sample supports measurement properties of the updated network capability and indicates that the new dimension in network capability research and sustainable development is important and can be added to the finalised network capability construct, (2) network capability, with the updated five dimensions, directly and positively influences eco-innovation capability and sustainable performance, and the impacts are more effective than in the previous four-dimensional construct, and (3) eco-innovation mediates the relationship between network capability with the updated five dimensions and enterprises’ sustainable performance, and the impact is more effective than in the previous four-dimensional construct. Therefore, our study will help strengthen the enterprise’s performance in promoting sustainable development.

Findings indicate that while a greater proclivity to innovate is beneficial for export market performance, a more complex web of relationships is revealed between the three export decision-making approaches and innovation orientation, providing insights on the operationalization of a dynamic decision-making capability. Specifically, while an increasing level of export planning reduces an exporter's capacity to innovate, creativity has a positive direct effect on exporters’ innovation orientation, which also benefits from extreme spontaneity in export decision-making.

In order to facilitate widespread and successful adoption of green entrepreneurial farming, it is crucial to address barriers inhibiting the uptake of green entrepreneurial activities in farming for the sustainability of natural resources as well as food provision. To this end, the present study aimed to investigate barriers in the adoption of green entrepreneurial farming in Pakistan. To fulfill the study objectives, after a comprehensive literature review and field visit, 34 barriers were identified. The results based on ranking analysis identified 20 out of 34 barriers as critical barriers to adoption of green entrepreneurial farming in the country. Furthermore, factor analysis was employed to group underlying 20 critical barriers into six major categories viz. 1) training and development-related barriers, 2) entrepreneurial orientation-related barriers, 3) market orientation-related barriers, 4) customer orientation-related barriers, 5) innovation orientation-related barriers, and 6) green supporting supplies-related barriers. Results showed that most dominant barrier among six groupings was training and development-related barriers and the marginal role of government in the provision of such endeavours. This implies that government needs to play a more active role in the adoption and promotion of green entrepreneurial farming in Punjab, Pakistan. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

To identify conditions under which EM is more or less effective, we analyze the relationship between EM and exploitative and exploratory innovation under conditions of high and low environmental competitiveness and high and low levels of firm size. Based on survey data from 146 German new ventures up to ten years old in the B2B sector, our results provide evidence of a significant and positive effect of EM on exploitative and exploratory innovation. We find, further, that under conditions of high competitive intensity, the effects of EM on exploratory innovation strengthen, while low levels of competitive intensity do not affect the relationship between EM and exploratory innovation. Our results also show that for larger firms, the positive effects of EM on exploitative innovation are weaker, while for smaller firms, those effects are stronger. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

It accumulates the teamwork culture dynamics and practices, their interrelationships and their combined impact on NPD team’s capability in terms of technological developments for NPD success. This practical analysis collects primary data from 263 design and development experts from Indian engineering manufacturing companies. Structural equation modeling (SEM) approach is applied to investigate the interrelationship among associated variables of teamwork culture and NPD team’s capability for NPD success. Concurrent engineering team (CET), communication infrastructure (CI), system integration (SI) and result orientation (RO) have been recognized as allied factors of teamwork culture. Successful adoption of associated variables ensures NPD success through influencing NPD team’s capability which in turn articulated by technological developments. The realization of combined impact of teamwork and its allied variables escalates technological developments which in turn enriches NPD team’s capability assuring organizational success. The result indicates that both CI and SI support CET for accelerating NPD team’s capability through technological developments. Besides, CET motivates innovation orientation most precisely referred as RO for escalating NPD team’s capability through technological developments for innovation. © 2018 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.},

Although recent research emphasises the influence of resource scarcity on SME innovation orientation, we argue that no clear hypothesis can be made about this relationship; rather, we focus on the role of managers and owners in influencing innovation orientation. We find that resource scarcity is not correlated with the innovation orientation of SMEs, while the growth ambitions of managers and owners strongly and positively influence their focus on both exploratory and exploitative innovation. Contrary to our expectations, we find that managerial perception of competitive intensity only moderately influences innovation orientation, while managerial perception of market growth does not influence innovation orientation. Our findings suggest that achieving ambidexterity is primarily a matter of ambition and entrepreneurial capability, rather than an issue of having the necessary resources or lucrative market conditions to innovate ambidextrously. As we also find that ambidextrous SMEs have the strongest innovation performance, our findings indicate that SMEs both can and should be ambidextrous. © The Author(s) 2019.},

This study argues that the lack of discipline in integrating projects makes project portfolio investments and anticipated benefits unclear, causing internal congestion of indecisive and/or unsuccessful projects. This research empirically scrutinizes project portfolio success in a transnational and cross-cultural perspective in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region. Based on samples drawn from the information and communications technology (ICT) industry in the Republic of Korea (an advanced economy) and Pakistan (an emerging economy), the hypothesized relationships were empirically tested using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The study findings revealed a significant and positive effect of CEO transformational leadership on project portfolio success. The findings also confirmed that strategic innovation orientation significantly mediates the effect of CEO transformational leadership on project portfolio success. In addition, this study provides support for portfolio governance mechanism in a moderating role that significantly enhanced the relationships between CEO transformational leadership and project portfolio success; also, strategic innovation orientation and project portfolio success. This study presents convergent views between Korea (Study-I) and Pakistan (Study-II) in terms of the application of CEO transformational leadership, portfolio governance and strategic innovation in explaining project portfolio success.

	abstract = {The entrepreneurial performance and success have been broadly studied in terms of Adult Education and Psychology. The concept of Ego Development has been often employed for the examination of these phenomena. At the same time, further research is needed in regard to women entrepreneurs in particular and national economic contexts. The complexity of the examined theoretical constructs does not allow for straightforward predictions in this direction. The current paper contributes to the outlined field with the examination of innovation orientation with reference to ego development of female business owners in Germany and Ireland. Using a sample for the target population in these two countries, we apply descriptive statistics, Chi- Square and Correlation analysis to examine multiple statistical relations between the target variables. Among others, we deliver the following key findings. The majority of the studied women entrepreneurs show the advanced levels of Ego Development, reaching its E5 (Self-Awareness) and E6 (Consciousness) stages. We also discover the national differences with this respect, showing higher development level for Irish participants than for German ones, also exceeding the managers’ level in the prominent literature to the topic. Similarly, the operationalization of innovation orientation through entrepreneurial orientation related to new ways of acting and solutions, as well as in the encouragement of other persons, is more strongly marked in Ireland than in Germany. In both countries, the support for this orientation is positively associated with the higher levels of Ego Development, namely Self-Awareness and Consciousness. The national differences are also reflected in the placement of the German sample on E5 (Self Awareness) level and the Irish one on E6 (Consciousness) stage. Additionally, we find the weak statistically significant correlation between the dimension and indicator of the discussed phenomenon in both countries. Nevertheless, when applying a comparative country-specific perspective, the conclusion upon the dimension and both indicators remains valid for Germany only. We have addressed the number of limitations and precautions when extrapolating the findings for the similar populations. The related socio-economic studies have been presented for the interpretation and application of the discovered psychological patterns. © 2019, Allied Business Academies. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Referring to current phenomena and consumer behaviour in tourism, this article develops the concept of conspicuous non-consumption. It addresses the deliberate avoidance of (over)spending during holidays and states that this behaviour may be just as conspicuous and provide social signals that are just as strong as those connected to the consumption of expensive luxury goods. The conceptual development is based on a combination of the two dichotomies of ‘consumption versus non-consumption’ and ‘conspicuous versus inconspicuous’, resulting in four conceptually distinctive categories of behaviour: conspicuous consumption, conspicuous non-consumption, inconspicuous non-consumption and conspicuous non-consumption. The latter, conspicuous non-consumption, is of special interest in this article, exemplified through personal vignettes. Explorative readings of travel blogs lead to the identification of five themes that characterize conspicuous non-consumption in tourism: ‘identity building’, ‘recycling, upcycling and repurposing’, ‘spiritualizing’, ‘retreating and detoxing’ and ‘slowing down’. Usually, tourism innovation policies are characterized by a ritual growth compulsion, and do not celebrate non-consumption, which is found to be synonymous with non-innovation. This is a paradox for the timely modernizing of tourist services and destinations. Increasingly, there is a need to reorient innovation and to give consideration to how the innovation of ‘nothing’ can also undergo a distinctive progression and even contribute positively to tourism economies. This article highlights the entry points for innovation at the tourism business and destination levels. © The Author(s) 2019.},

	abstract = {The transition from an industrial economy to an innovation economy poses two critical questions for the manufacturing sector in advanced countries. First, given the diffusion of modern manufacturing practices around the world, what level of innovation (incremental, more far-ranging, or radical) is most likely to support a resilient domestic manufacturing sector? Second, are assumed differences in the innovative capacity across space likely to hasten the decline of rural manufacturing? To answer these questions this research combines comprehensive measures of self-reported innovation able to reliably differentiate incremental and more far-ranging innovation with establishment-level data able to examine the geographical distribution of these different innovation strategies. The data used for the analysis includes a two-period panel of manufacturing establishments surveyed in 1996 and 2013 with annual employment data indicating survival in the intervening years. Our findings suggest that long-surviving manufacturing plants overwhelmingly gravitate away from non-innovation strategies toward incremental or more far-ranging innovation orientations. A survival advantage of far-ranging innovation over incremental innovation is observed for standalone firms. We do not identify a difference in the innovation orientations of rural and urban manufacturing establishments. © 2018},

	abstract = {Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) has become a new buzzword in science policy, pointing to a shift in the role of research in contemporary societies. While on a discursive level responsibility is easily welcomed, implementing RRI in research practice appears challenging. RRI as an agent for change must compete with other forces shaping the current research system and its institutions, such as innovation orientation, competition and indicator-driven evaluation cultures. To address these challenges, we created a new format for engaging life science researchers in reflections on the meaning of responsibility in their own research practices. In this conceptual paper, we present and discuss a card-based method: IMAGINE RRI. The method’s aim is twofold. First, it is meant to empower researchers to appropriate RRI through shared reflection while connecting it to their practices. Second, it aims to enable researchers to reflect on how the institutional context of their work and the embedded values fosters or hinders responsible research practices.

Research featuring investments in information technology (IT) and market-oriented IT (MOIT) competence to facilitate the flow of firm innovativeness (FI) across multisectoral start-ups is yet to be identified. Further, the role of innovation orientation (IO)-enabled firm innovativeness (FI) on sustainable competitive advantage (SCA) needs further exploration in the light of customer orientation (CO) of the enterprise. It is partially because the underlying mechanism remains largely unexplored in the context of rippling start-ups. In the current research, we conceptualized and tested a model that examines the role of MOIT competence and knowledge sharing mechanism (KSM) on FI and SCA, in the light of Resource Advantage (R-A) theory and SD logic (SDL) framework. This model also proposes and establishes IO as an important enabler for firm’s competitive advantage. Using a sample of 267 start-up ventures registered under Start-up India Programme (DIPP, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India), we tested above-mentioned relationship using SPSS AMOS 22. Results show that MOIT competence is an important enabler for FI and in turn SCA of the firm. CO strongly moderates the role of IO on firm’s competitive advantage. © 2019 International Management Institute, New Delhi.},

Furthermore, we find that eco-innovation is highly persistent at the firm level, past eco-innovation behavior being clearly of key importance in explaining the current state of a firm's eco-innovation orientation.

However, many real estate developers in China are less willing to develop GRBs, because of the factors affecting green residential building development (GRBD). In order to promote the sustainable development of GRBs in China, this paper, based on the perspective of real estate developers, identifies the influential and critical factors affecting GRBD, using the method of social network analysis (SNA). Firstly, 14 factors affecting GRBD are determined from 64 preliminary factors of three main elements, and the framework is established. Secondly, the relationships between the 14 factors are analyzed by SNA. Finally, four critical factors for GRBD, which are on the local economy development level, development strategy and innovation orientation, developer's acknowledgement and positioning for GRBD, and experience and ability for GRBD, are identified by the social network centrality test. The findings illustrate the key issues that affect the development of GRBs, and provide references for policy making by the government and strategy formulation by real estate developers. © 2018 by the author.},

However, the primary phases in gender differences are still ambiguous when examined from this perspective, possibly due to the fact that most of the studies have targeted samples of upper secondary school or college students. As such, in this study we examined the transient period to lower secondary school; our aim was to discover to what extent relationships between factors of students’ science interest and career perspectives differ between male and female. Based on previous studies and analyses, we selected three future career perspective variables–outcome, personal time, and innovation orientations–and three defining features of interest–personal value, enjoyment, and cognitive aspect. The sample was conducted in Finland and comprised of 401 grade 7 students aged 13, using a multi-group structural equation modelling. This study found that during the transient period there were clear gender differences regarding interest and preferences of science subjects, as well as their relationship towards future career perspectives. To be specific, biology was preferred by females, and males preferred physics and chemistry. With regard to future career perspectives, female students’ science interest was positively correlated with personal time- and innovation-oriented career perspectives; an outcome-oriented career expectation was negatively related to their interest. Interpretation and implication that might possibly arise from the results were also discussed. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

This is surprising because strategic planning is among the most widely used strategic decision-making tools in management practice and one of the most extensively studied concepts in management research. In addition, prior research has demonstrated the potential of strategic planning to impact innovation-related outcomes—both positively and negatively. Here, we investigate the association between strategic planning and organizational ambidexterity using a survey of 217 senior executives. We highlight the importance of considering how executives use strategic planning. Our results support the hypothesis that strategic planning's positive or negative association with organizational ambidexterity is contingent on other organizational factors. Our findings reveal that strategic planning is only positively associated with organizational ambidexterity when leaders' innovation orientation is extraordinarily high. We further contextualize this interaction effect by considering the environmental uncertainty perceived by the top management.

To check our contentions, we surveyed professionals from 322 firms that conducted crowdfunding campaigns. For IO and SSM, we used preexisting scales, while for CFS we created and validated our own seven-item scale. We found that IO alone does not fully account for CFS, but rather its effect is based on a firm’s ability to SSM.

This research topic is important because it can provide a better understanding of the relationship between innovation orientation and performance, since most of the previous papers that have analyzed this relationship have done so from a short-term perspective. But the effect of innovation orientation on performance may not be immediate and short-term, but long-term, and may be influenced by the company’s ability to develop marketing capabilities. A sample of 77 independent hotels is taken for empirical contrast and a system of structural equations is modelled using the Partial Least Squares (PLS) technique. The results show that the company’s capacity to understand the market in which it operates functions as a mechanism that intervenes in the relationship between innovation orientation and long-term result, with a mediating effect that explains the positive effect of innovation orientation on the long-term results. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.},

Addressing this gap, we examine the effect of perceived integrity in leadership on both subjective firm performance and objective employee productivity. Applying dynamic capabilities theory, we propose that perceived integrity in leadership may not only directly affect the outcome variables but also moderate the effect of the firm’s multiple-strategy implementation on outcome variables. We test the hypotheses using multiple informants from a transitional economy with an ineffective legal and incomplete institutional environment, which could seriously challenge the leader’s commitment to integrity. As hypothesized, perceived integrity is associated with manager’s perception of firm performance directly and objective employee productivity through its moderating role in the firm’s implementation process of dual strategies. The results illustrate that perceived integrity in leadership plays as an important driver for employee productivity in dual-strategy and non-strategy firms. We provide detailed discussions about the integrity challenge and call for additional future research on this topic. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.},

Drawing on the knowledge-spillover literature and resource-dependence theory, this study investigates the effects of new product development (NPD) alliances on building cross-functional capabilities, testing the influences of important organisational, strategic, and environmental contingencies. Based on survey data collected from 212 Chinese firms, the findings reveal that, for resource-abundant firms, R&D-focused NPD alliances have cross-functional fertilisation effects on marketing capabilities; whereas for resource-constrained or highly innovative firms such alliances cannibalise marketing capabilities; in dynamic markets, marketing-focused NPD alliances cross-fertilise technological capabilities, but such an effect is weaker in firms adopting a highly incremental innovation orientation. Overall, this study sheds new light on how NPD alliances affect cross-functional capabilities under important contingencies. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

The purpose of this paper is to answer this question, a strategic typology that integrates branding and innovation (BI) from an organizational ambidexterity perspective is proposed. Design/methodology/approach: This paper builds theory by proposing a typology. Integrating the literature on BI, organizational ambidexterity and resource/knowledge-based view of firms, this study posits that to create a value proposition, a firm could choose to engage in innovation and branding activities in a variety of ways depending on their dominant strategic orientation along two dimensions of ambidexterity. Findings: The four proposed typical branding-innovation orientations are low innovation × low branding; low innovation × high branding; high innovation × low branding; and high innovation × high branding. Practical implications: A firm should choose its dominant strategic orientation depending on conditions such as market, consumers, needs and demand and resources. Originality/value: By framing the innovation-branding paradox within an organizational ambidexterity framework, the proposed typology helps integrate two complementary and yet conflicting organizational functions by shifting the focus from an operational to a strategic level. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

There is a need to better understand which individual- and contextual-level factors are related to engineering students' entrepreneurial intentions. Purpose/Hypothesis: This study explores individual and contextual predictors of entrepreneurial intent among undergraduate women and men in engineering and business majors. Entrepreneurial intent is defined as the personal importance that students ascribe to starting a new business or organization. Design/Method: The participants included 518 engineering and 471 business undergraduates from 51 U.S. colleges and universities. We examined relationships first by discipline and then by gender in each discipline using regression models with interaction terms. Results: Innovation orientation and participation in entrepreneurship activities tied to intent more strongly for engineering students than for business students; in contrast, being at a research institution and selection of novel goals tied to intent more strongly for business students than for their engineering peers. Among engineering students only, being able to switch gears and apply alternative means for reaching one's goal in the face of setbacks was positively related with women's entrepreneurial intent but not with men's. Conclusions: Entrepreneurial intent is a function of individual-level characteristics and academic and social contexts, with some degree of discipline-specific effects. Diversifying the community of aspiring engineering entrepreneurs is a critical issue that merits attention by the engineering education community. © 2019 The Authors.

	abstract = {Innovative offerings facilitate hotels to expand the segment of loyal customers, who display stronger re-patronage intention and recommendation willingness. Innovation performance is essential for enhancing hotel management performance. According to the holistic innovation paradigm, successful innovation should be holistic in nature and comprise novel, utilitarian and experiential value dimensions. Empirical findings also attest to the conduciveness of holistic innovation to heightening customer loyalty. However, the antecedents and outcome of holistic innovation are still unclear in the hotel context. The current study validates a theoretical framework via surveys administered on the chief executive officers and customers of 112 five-star hotels. As the research result suggests, ambidextrous innovation orientation and value co-creation capabilities are primary drivers of holistic innovation. In turn, the three value dimensions of holistic innovation relate positively to customer loyalty with variant effect sizes. The research result contributes to hotel management both academically and practically. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

The purpose of this paper is to explore the impact of equity sensitivity on employee mental health. Innovation is considered to be among the critical drivers for the success and future of organizational existence, therefore this paper also investigates how the equity sensitivity impacts innovation orientation and turnover intentions across two geographies India and Hungary. Design/methodology/approach: An online survey was carried out among Hungarian and Indian students. Students were selected only on the basis of having two to three years of work experience and also from good business and economics colleges from India and Hungary. Findings: The results were analyzed using partial least square–structural equation modelling method to test the hypotheses and it showed that equity sensitivity has a positive effect on employee mental health. The findings of the study highlight that even with significant cultural differences equity sensitivity perception does not differ between Hungary and India. Research limitations/implications: The relationship between equity sensitivity and employee mental health is an important area to understand in a volatile economy. Innovation orientation and turnover intention both are important to understand the productivity of any organization; this paper is an effort to understand the impact of both variables bringing in the positive or negative impact on the growth of an organization. Limitations of this study include the sample size, cross-sectional data. Future studies can be based on a larger sample size from wider cross-sections and cultures. Practical implications: Managers need to give importance to understand the equity sensitivity of employee and how it impacts their mental health and well-being. Knowing the volatile nature of economy this becomes very relevant and important for managers and organizations. Social implications: This study is important to understand that how two countries that are significantly different in cultural values still have no difference in equity sensitivity perception. Therefore, equity sensitivity is an important determinant to bring innovation and productivity in organizations across cultures. Originality/value: These findings contribute to literature of equity sensitivity by exploring the impact of equity sensitivity on employee mental health in the context of two countries. Mental health is a concern not only in India but also in Hungarian context as well. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This article interrogates the relationships between innovation and firm survival, as a proxy for competitiveness, and considers firm size as a key determinant of tourism innovation. In addition, the motivators and drivers of tourism innovation are analyzed. The Western Cape investigation reveals that innovation is part of a deliberate strategy for competitiveness by dynamic tourism firms. Further motivations comprise enhancing efficiency and productivity, ensuring survival, and behaving ethically. © 2017 Cognizant, LLC.},

The validity concern is caused primarily by the innovation dimension. We adopt a critical lens to evaluate the dimensions and associated measures of EO and contribute to the ongoing conversation on EO, by empirically testing its indicators and measures. Data collected from 404 firms in Oman are analysed using a two-step approach, initially conducting EFA and CFA tests, followed by structural equation modelling. The results suggest that innovation orientation significantly improves the clarity of the innovation dimension and is more congruent with EO's conceptualisation. The study further clarifies that EO consists of enabling measures that contribute to the generation of entrepreneurial outputs in corporations. The five-factor EO construct is specified formatively and a comprehensive list of measures is drawn from multiple scales associated with EO research.  Copyright © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

This is illustrated in our review of data from 50 case studies, where combining a CEO narrative analysis with secondary data on the nature of the firm has identified seven generic manufacturing business models. We observe these may be adopted singly or in combination to pursue a competitive advantage, and the dominant business model may change over time as new capabilities are developed and/or in response to market changes. © 2018 Universidade do Porto - Faculdade de Engenharia.},

	abstract = {Background: This article compares the performance of firms in resource-rich sectors of the Peruvian economy with that of businesses operating in service sectors. Objectives: In so doing, the research seeks to examine whether innovation is managed differently by firms operating in different sectors of a developing-country economy and whether the performance of firms in an emerging economy may be influenced by innovation and learning practices at the sectoral level. Method: Data were acquired through a survey of overwhelmingly middle managers working in Peru. Results: According to the survey findings, the performance of firms in the resource-rich sectors appeared to be uninfluenced by innovation or involvement in organisational learning. In contrast, firms in the service sectors not only exhibited an innovation orientation and involvement in learning but also reported higher sales growth. Conclusion: The study concludes that firms operating in the resource-rich sectors of Peru’s economy do not appear to benefit from engaging in innovation or learning at this point in time, whereas such activities are advantageous for service sector businesses. Therefore, the relationship between innovation, learning and performance may be influenced not just by the type of economy but also by the sector in which the firms are operating. © 2018.

This study examines the agriculture entrepreneurship and farmers' performance in the context of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). A survey was conducted to collect primary data from three agricultural zones adjacent to the under-construction CPEC in Pakistan. According to the results, market orientation, entrepreneurial orientation, innovation orientation, and opportunity recognition positively influence agriculture entrepreneurship thereby facilitating timely distribution of food commodities in ensuring food security. Our findings also indicate that uptake of entrepreneurship complements farmers' marketing, operational and economic performance. These findings do imply that improving farmers' entrepreneurial skills is the essential element for their improved performance in terms of locating potential markets and timely delivery of primary commodities, such as food items. It suggests that farmers might seek enormous economic opportunities arising from improved infrastructure, output linkages, connectivity and access to global markets through the CPEC. Based on the findings, the study provides implications for policymakers to channelize the potential endeavors for facilitating the farmers' access to new markets and getting the foremost advantage of Belt and Road Initiative.

	abstract = {This paper presents the empirical results of a recently concluded research study about managing menu innovation in a consumer market that has reached to its saturation level. Such market condition resulting in increased competition and, therefore, a need for increased innovation is essential. In this study, an investigation was carried in substantiating the effect of market saturation toward the relationship between innovation orientations and new menu innovation process. The region of Klang Valley was chosen as the study setting for its dynamic and matured consumer foodservice market. In this investigation, the theoretical conceptualization and the empirical validation of the proposed menu innovation process as a second-order hierarchical model along with the moderating variable of market saturation as first-order constructs were first advanced using both Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS version 19) and partial least squares. Empirically, the measurement and structural models of this study confirmed adequate estimations based on partial least squares path modeling parameters. In line with the strength of partial least squares to explain complex relationships, the use of path modeling has made it possible to advance the theoretical contribution to this study. The results show that the moderating effect of market saturation on the link between the exogenous and endogenous variables found to have a medium effect size (f2= 0.289) and significant at ρ < 0.05). The findings point to managerial challenges in shaping competition as evidence of radical innovations is still being pursued, although slightly weaken. This study, apart from its contribution to the model development of menu innovation process, has meaningful implications for restaurateurs to stay afloat in such a market condition. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.},

	abstract = {Purpose: An organisation’s performance tends to be associated with its innovativeness. However, innovation remains challenging in the construction industry, partially due to the complex nature of this industry. Nevertheless, innovation orientations (i.e. creation and adoption) shed new light on innovation in the construction industry. These orientations are similar but not entirely identical. Although most studies do not discuss these orientations in any detail, this study aims to classify the characteristics of the innovation orientations and determines the state of innovation among construction companies in Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach: A survey questionnaire was mailed to 1,230 construction companies in Malaysia. Descriptive analysis was used to examine the respondents’ profiles, and factor analysis was used to classify the innovation orientation characteristics. A paired samples t-test was used to determine the state of innovation among the construction companies. Findings: Innovation creation reflects a pioneer’s efforts and involves being a market explorer that tolerates risk and is research and development (R&D)-oriented, whereas innovation adoption involves being a creative imitator, a market follower and a safe player. Construction companies in Malaysia are innovation adoption–oriented. Research limitations/implications: This study uses quantitative methods only; therefore, the findings are statistically oriented. The small sample size makes generalisation challenging, so this study reflects only the built environment of the developing country of Malaysia. Originality/value: This study classifies the characteristics of innovation creation and innovation adoption with respect to the innovation orientation of construction companies in Malaysia. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This study explores alternative theories for rural settings, by analyzing establishment-level survey data combined with data on the local arts scene. The study identifies the local contextual factors associated with a strong design orientation, and estimates the impact that a strong design orientation has on the local economy. Method Data on innovation and design come from a nationally representative sample of establishments in tradable industries. Latent class analysis allows identifying unobserved subpopulations comprised of establishments with different design and innovation orientations. Logistic regression allows estimating the association between an establishment’s design orientation and local contextual factors. A quantile instrumental variable regression allows assessing the robustness of the logistic regression results with respect to endogeneity. An estimate of design orientation at the local level derived from the survey is used to examine variation in economic performance during the period of recovery from the Great Recession (2010–2014). Results Three distinct innovation (substantive, nominal, and non-innovators) and design orientations (design-integrated, “design last finish,” and no systematic approach to design) are identified. Innovation- and design-intensive establishments were identified in both rural and urban areas. Rural design-integrated establishments tended to locate in counties with more highly educated workforces and containing at least one performing arts organization. A quantile instrumental variable regression confirmed that the logistic regression result is robust to endogeneity concerns. Finally, rural areas characterized by design-integrated establishments experienced faster growth in wages relative to rural areas characterized by establishments using no systematic approach to design. © This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

The study empirically validates the model using data collected from 379 French manufacturing companies. This is the first study that examines how buyers perceive the role of blockchain technology in exploring and exploiting innovation management in the Industry 4.0 era. The study advances understanding on the theory of ambidexterity of supply chains in buyer–supplier relationships. The study results show the positive effect between internal integration and blockchain technology as well as relational social capital factors in buyer–supplier relationships. The findings underscore the critical role of relational and technological capital in buyer–supplier relationships, specifically to act as a catalyst for exploiting internal capabilities to achieve the innovation targets.

	abstract = {The role of non-government organizations (NGOs) has been commendable in promoting sustainable farming. Through mobilization of existing resources and provision of training to farmers on various agriculture subjects, NGOs could trigger increased productivity and agricultural sustainability. However, empirical evidence on this claim is limited and no study recognizes the supporting conditions required for NGO intervention to improve productivity. Cross-sectional data from hazelnut farmers in Azerbaijan are used to evaluate the role of NGO intervention in improving farmers' technical efficiency. To this end, stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) is applied to study hazelnut farmers' production efficiency. Three different measures are employed to estimate NGO intervention: Training, subsidy and, a combination of training and subsidy. The results indicate that NGO intervention is not significant in influencing technical efficiency. This is attributable to the absence of good organization, innovation orientation, accountability and stakeholder involvement and support which are the necessary supporting conditions facilitating an enabling environment for NGO intervention to improve farmers' technical efficiency. Therefore, we recommend policy directed at addressing these issues in order to simultaneously enhance farmers' productivity and improve the functioning of the NGOs. Beyond NGO intervention, encouraging farmers to specialize in hazelnut production and allocating more suitable land for hazelnut production will also improve farmers' technical efficiency significantly. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Various pieces of information and knowledge turn into “know-how” simply by their application in the market. This applies to all spheres of activities. It is therefore important to know and understand the requirements of customers already in the stage of making a product, and to confront these with the possibilities of a producer. In this article we are exploring the possibilities of a better understanding of the requirements of customers and stakeholders in the process of the creation of products in educational services. In particular, we examined seven general requirements: practice orientation, ethical orientation, research orientation, quality resources, innovation orientation, skills orientation, and quality staff. We use the Kano model on a pilot sample of respondents at an institution of higher education. Our results showed that “practice orientation” and “quality resources” are the most stable requirements, while “quality staff” is the least stable. The most linear requirement (the same effect on satisfaction and dissatisfaction) is “innovation orientation”. “Research orientation” belongs to attractive requirements and we also found that in the case of “ethical orientation” there are weak relations between positive and negative responses in our survey. The “skills orientation” proved to be too general, and our research shows that it could be indifferent. It is therefore advisable to specify the investigated skills when investigating requirements on educational services. The main contribution based on the proposed research procedures is an effective linking of customers and producers already from the beginning of constructing a value chain. Investing in sophisticated management approaches when modelling products and processes can thus become a significant source of the competitive advantage of an educational institution. At the same time, it is a contribution to better placing of its graduates in the labor market. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

As a result, these advances are putting pressure on the retail sector to find new and efficient solutions to boost retail and customer experience. Meanwhile, in Central Java, Indonesia, there is one specific SME type that is part of the nation's cultural heritage, namely Batik SME. This study aims to determine the effect of Intangible Assets and Innovation Orientation on the Competitive Advantages of Batik SMEs in Central Java, Indonesia. This study's method was an explanatory survey method with a type of decompression-verification study from primary data obtained from Batik SMEs and using PLS SEM in analyzing the data of the book. The results of this study indicate that Intangible Assets with Path coefficient (β) = 0.320, P value <0.001 (<α = 0.05), and Innovation Orientation with Path coefficient (β) = 0.28 P value <0.038 (<α = 0.05), have a positive effect on Competitive Advantage with coefficient (β) = 0.46, P value <0.001 (<α = 0.05). This result means that the better Intangible Assets would improve the Batik SME Competitive Advantage. Besides, the Orientation owned by Batik SME would increase the Competitive Advantage. Batik SME in Central Java should improve the quality of their Intangible Asset and Innovation Orientation to increase their Competitive Advantage. Copyright © 2021 by authors, all rights reserved.},

Through a case study of five proactive firms, proactive activities are identified. Using three strategic orientations—customer, competition, and innovation orientation—unique proactivity profiles are created, reflecting the patterns in the identified proactive activities. Through these profiles, three overarching proactive market strategies are forwarded: market shaping, customer engagement, and innovation leadership. These are proposed to act as generic proactive market strategies, representing coordinated proactive activities driven by multiple strategic orientations and aimed at creating customer value. These generic strategies help us understand of the role of proactivity in crafting high-performing market strategies by representing different routes to success. © 2019 The Authors},

Design/methodology/approach: The paper adopts a contingent approach that examines the two organizational factors in determining the shape of the SB-IP curve. The empirical study is based on survey data gathered from 414 Chinese firms. In dealing with concerns on simultaneity and reverse causality, perceived time-lag between outcome variable and explanatory variables was introduced. Findings: This study reveals that knowledge novelty and absorptive capacity are two functions underlying the SB-IP relationship. The results also indicate that innovation orientation and firm age moderate the SB-IP relationship in different ways: the more innovation-oriented the firm, the steeper the inverted U-shaped SB-IP relationship will be, while the older the firm, the flatter the SB-IP relationship will be. Interestingly, there is strong evidence for the shape-flip phenomenon of the SB-IP curve: SB has an inverted U-shaped effect on IP when a firm is young; however, SB has a U-shaped effect when the firm is older than 37 years. Originality/value: By revealing two underlying functions and two moderators of the association between SB and IP at the firm level, this paper contributes to shed some new light to the mixed results reported by previous empirical studies that have examined the effect of knowledge search on firm innovation. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The major purpose of this research is to provide a refined understanding of the effects of a CEO’s technically oriented functional background and cross-functional coordination on the firm’s technological innovation performance by including as a mediating variable in the research model the construct of technological innovation orientation which has been recently identified as an important factor affecting the firm’s technological innovation performance. Strategic management and innovation research has suggested managerial functional background as a crucial factor affecting the successful innovation outcomes. Nevertheless, no empirical analysis has been conducted on the relationship between CEOs’ or top managers’ functional backgrounds and the organizational innovation performance. One plausible reason for the absence of prior research empirically examining the relationship between managerial functional background and innovation performance may be that the research has failed to identify some intervening mechanism through which managers’ relevant functional backgrounds influence the firm’s innovation outcomes. Cross-functional coordination has been frequently recognized as a crucial driver for the firm’s successful technological or product innovation performance. Yet, previous empirical research has provided a limited support for the direct positive impact of cross-functional coordination on such innovation performance. Research has shown that that cross-functional coordination may not be sufficient on its own to generate the firm’s superior technological or product innovation performance due to some inherent adverse effects it brings about. Given lack of extant empirical research exploring relevant mediating mechanisms that may link cross-functional coordination with firm innovation performance, the controversy regarding the direct impact of cross-functional coordination on innovation performance remains unsettled. In an effort to fill up the aforementioned gaps or deficiencies in previous studies, the present research proposed and empirically tested a conceptual research model and hypotheses in which a CEO’s technically oriented functional background and cross-functional coordination affect the firm’s technological innovation performance, directly and indirectly, via technological innovation orientation. Technological innovation orientation represents an organizational culture conceptualized as an organization-wide direction of thinking toward creating or adopting new ideas, products, services, or processes. Analysis of a sample of 87 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the Korean IT industry revealed that technological innovation orientation fully and positively mediated the relationship between the firm’s technological innovation performance and a CEO’s technically oriented functional background and cross-functional coordination, respectively. Both a CEO’s technically oriented functional background and cross-functional coordination did not have significant direct effects on the firm’s technological innovation performance when technological innovation orientation was controlled in the model. Theoretical and practical implications for the results of this research were discussed. © 2017 People and Global Business Association.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore a way to reshape the business ecosystem for existing industries by comparing traditional and Shanzhai networks in China. The research is also conducted on the supporting activities by service intermediaries in the ecosystem. Design/methodology/approach: This research starts with a literature review on firms' strategy of industry maturity from three perspectives, including technology orientation, innovation orientation, and network orientation. The approach of multiple case studies is adopted to unveil the reshaping process of the business ecosystem. Two types of networks are mapped: the traditional mobile companies' network and the Shanzhai network. Intra-network and inter-network cross-case analyses aim to generate the research findings and provide implications for different ecosystem players. Findings: First, the relationship between industry and the business ecosystem is placed into a two by two matrix. Second, in order to reshape the business ecosystem, the traditional network prefers geographical dispersion to other countries to establish a new ecosystem, whereas the Shanzhai network brings niche substitutes to cut down industry entry barriers. Third, government agencies, as one of the service intermediaries, not only support the traditional network dispersion by providing preferential policies, but also support the reshaping process enabled by the Shanzhai network with legal guidance and resource capture. Fourth, other service intermediaries such as law firms, technology services, talent searchers, financial and industry associations, have greater impact on the Shanzhai network than on the traditional network. Fifth, from the comparison between these two networks, strategies to reshape the ecosystem can be differentiated in five aspects: frugal solution, platform enablement, organization recentralization, downstream innovation, and regulation adaptation. Research limitations/implications: This research further develops the observations into service intermediaries not only in core business but also in the extended level of the business ecosystem. The Shanzhai phenomenon also provides an excellent example implicating classical theories like cluster, innovation and global manufacturing virtual network. From a methodology perspective, this research combined the roadmap methods and cross-case analysis. However, this study focuses more on Shanzhai network study than the traditional network. Practical implications: Five nurturing strategies implicate small firms in the Shanzhai network and large firms in the traditional network as well as service intermediaries. Originality/value: This paper is the first one to deeply study the relationship between industry and the business ecosystem in China, and the reshaping process of a mature business ecosystem from the traditional network, Shanzhai network and service intermediaries' perspectives. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

A number of hypotheses are tested using structural equation modelling using data collected through a quantitative survey. The hypothesis that customer orientation and innovation orientation are related to technology commercialisation capability and the hypothesis that technology commercialisation capability is related to technology commercialisation performance are accepted, while the hypothesis that competitor orientation is related to technology commercialisation capability is not supported. From a theoretical perspective, the research contributes to a broader application of the resource-based view in technology commercialisation research area, through exploring intangible resources (organisational orientations) and capability (technology commercialisation capability) that relate to technology commercialisation performance. From a practical perspective, in order to improve technology commercialisation performance, managers should monitor the speed of each commercialisation step: initiate the development of products (research); develop products (development); and launch the products to the market, so that the product arrives on the market in an appropriate time. Managers should also consider matching product customisation and market segment so that appropriate products are delivered to appropriate market segments. In addition, managers should monitor technology developments in the related industry, select appropriate technologies, acquire the technologies and integrate the technologies into their products, so that the improved product performs better than the previous product and competitors' product. © 2014 RADMA and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Organizational corruption is a wide-spread negative aspect of economic activity, and a seemingly never-ending series of corruption scandals has been made public around the globe. Although research is performed in a broad variety of disciplines, ranging from psychology to management to law, a fully satisfactory explanation for the causes of organizational corruption has not been found. By looking at organizational factors as potential triggers for corruptive behavior, this study draws upon the concept of entrepreneurial orientation (EO). Diverse studies have shown that EO, as an antecedent to company performance, has a positive effect. Recent EO literature, however, indicates that EO has not only positive but also negative consequences. In this line of reasoning, this study builds upon principal agent theory and makes a first step in exploring the impact of EO on a negative aspect of business behavior, namely organizational corruption. We gathered survey data and publicly available data from 411 firms, inquiring for both acts of corruption from within the top management team over the last 3 years and the level of entrepreneurial orientation within the organization. Results show diverging effects along the individual dimensions of EO; they point to risk orientation as the dark side of EO, as it significantly increases the likelihood of corrupt behavior in companies. In contrast, innovation orientation, to a certain extent, counterbalances by reducing the likelihood of corrupt behavior. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

Findings reveal that six transformational-leader behaviors positively influence innovation orientation but with differing levels of intensity. Only two of these relationships, "providing an appropriate model" and "accepting group goals," are culturally independent, while the other behaviors' effects tend to be culturally dependent. For example, "providing intellectual stimulation" has a stronger effect in collectivist cultures, cultures with high power distance, and low uncertainty-avoidance cultures than in other cultures.

This interaction is manifested in all the other basic characteristics of a developing economy and gives them a special quality. Another development is the vector orientation of production to create economic benefits to meet the needs of the highest order. Following vector of development is the increase in the economy and in society such specific services, such as information. Vector of development is a dialectical process of concentration and centralization of production and capital. Important vector of development is the specification of property rights on the basis of various quality changes. New forms, subjects, objects (including intangible assets) occur continuously. An important vector of the current world economic development is to strengthen innovation orientation. Vector of economic development is the increasing interdependence of economic actors, not only in the scale of the national economy, but also on a global scale.

	abstract = {Although upper echelon literature has found evidence for the effect of executives’ characteristics on firm strategy such as the level of research and development (R&D) intensity, research on how different behaviors, values, personalities, motivations, and experiences of executives influence the R&D intensity of small and medium-sized firms is scarce. Applying upper echelon theory, this study uses firm growth (sales and employee growth) as a contingency factor to analyze variations in the effect of chief executive officer (CEO) innovation orientation on R&D intensity in small and medium-sized firms. As research on the direct effect of firm growth on R&D intensity is inconclusive, this study applies firm growth as an indirect effect to show whether the impact of CEO innovation orientation on R&D intensity differs in times of low growth compared to times of high growth in small and medium-sized firms. Using a sample of 77 German CEOs of small and medium-sized firms operating in manufacturing industries, results show that CEO innovation orientation has a positive effect on R&D intensity, and firm growth affects this relationship. Specifically, high CEO innovation orientation has a positive effect on R&D intensity in firms with low growth, while its impact disappears in firms that experience strong growth. Implications and future research are discussed. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {An eco-innovation is any innovation that reduces environmental damage. Even though eco-innovating is a key trend in industry today, relatively little research has been conducted on its implications for the automobile industry. In this article, the attitude toward the environment while innovating is analyzed using the SEM (Structural Equation Model) technique, applied to a data set of 223 Spanish automotive companies. Results of a statistical analysis with this data set show that companies which focus on processes and products when innovating tend to be more environmentally oriented and tend to highlight the importance of information sources more than those which do not have a focus on process and product innovation. Further, our results show that companies which see market information sources (coming from suppliers, clients, competitors, and external consultants) as important in the process of innovation and development of new products and markets are also more environmentally oriented. The consistency in our findings suggests that companies which look for more operational flexibility, increased production capacity, reduced labor costs per unit, or reduced energy consumption per unit when innovating are also more prepared to adopt an environmental orientation. These results have important managerial implications for firms that are trying to go greener as it highlights the variables that should be considered in their effort to be more environmentally oriented and the key elements to lead companies from innovation toward eco-innovation. Learning from this study will help managerial decision-making. The variety of variables analyzed allows practitioners to discover conclusions relevant to the engineering management field.},

Do these M&As create value when Chinese firms acquire foreign target firms suffering heavy losses and even on the verge of bankruptcy? This article explores the wealth effect of M&As conducted by Chinese firms as well as the relevant factors from the asset-seeking perspective. The authors use 180 M&A cases conducted by listed firms in China between 2002 and 2012 as samples and examine their wealth effects in a method of event study. The results show that these M&A activities have produced significant positive wealth effects during the event window of [-10, 10]. The authors then study the key factors affecting wealth effects. The findings reveal that an acquiring firm’s strength via research and development (R&D) and M&A experience generates significant positive impacts on the wealth effect. The findings also reveal that an innovation orientation and development stage of host countries helps create positive wealth effects; vertical M&As are particularly favored by the market since they can gain easier access to R&D, marketing channels or mineral resources. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

Relatedly, a firm’s sustainable innovations capabilities as a source of competitive advantage and the sustainability related attributes of a firm’s product offerings as bases for market segmentation, target marketing, positioning, and differentiation can also be expected to grow in importance. The emergence of sustainability as a major driver of innovation highlights a number of important issues that merit investigation, such as potential avenues for sustainable innovation and sustainable product innovation and factors underlying differences between firms in their commitment to a sustainable innovations orientation. In an attempt to gain insights into these issues, this paper presents (1) a conceptual framework delineating potential avenues for sustainable innovations and (2) a conceptual model delineating a number of firm-related and industry-related antecedents of sustainable innovations orientation, along with performance outcomes of sustainable innovations orientation.

This paper draws together the concepts of creating shared value, the stakeholder theory, and socially oriented innovation to research companies' decisions on asserting socially related objectives when innovating. We examine the extent to which this decision process is bounded by constraints related to information and the characteristics of innovation. To perform this study we used a dataset that monitors the innovation activities of companies. This study offers an empirical analysis of the influence on firms' social innovation orientation. The empirical analysis supports the theoretical framework and identifies the firm's community links as key factors in developing new innovations, process and product-oriented, which have an impact on the social-innovation orientation of the firm. Additionally, it shows how the setting up of social goals when innovating is affected by the information source and the innovation mode being developed.

Design/methodology/approach: Using empirical data drawn from 180 managers in Australian service organisations, this study also compares the effect of ambidextrous innovation on business performance within these SMEs. Findings: The findings show that, controlled for size, neither of the innovation orientations show significant, direct relationships with firms' performance. However, ambidextrous innovation was positively associated with business performance, indicating a synergy between exploration and exploitation. Further examination indicates the relationship between exploration/exploitation innovation and performance is moderated by size within the authors' sample of small firms. Research limitations/implications: Taken together, the results point to an interesting and complex relationship within SMEs relating to innovation orientation, size, and performance. This relationship suggests that service SMEs are best served by the simultaneous pursuit of both exploitive and exploratory innovation.

The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – The proposed new model of antecedents and outcomes of sustainable supply chain initiatives underwent a rigorous empirical test through structural equation modeling with samples from an emerging market. Findings – The results show that firms that implement sustainable supply chain initiatives can realize positive reverse logistics outcomes; the study also provides new insights into eco-innovation and eco-reputation strategic orientations as theoretically important antecedents of sustainable supply chain initiatives. Research limitations/implications – Though the authors identify three components of sustainable supply chain initiatives, other components could exist, and ongoing research should investigate them.

Design/methodology/approach: Survey data were drawn from a sample of 181 firms operating in the consumer goods sector (i.e. fashion, consumer electronics and automobile) and tested through a hierarchical regression analysis. Findings: This study finds that the sole and exclusive focus on either brand orientation or innovation orientation is detrimental to the realisation of superior brand performance because increased levels of this focus lead to diminishing returns. Critically, this study finds that the key to achieving superior brand performance lies in the extent to which the firm integrates both brand orientation and innovation orientation. Originality/value: This study extends current knowledge by showing that focusing on either brand orientation or innovation orientation in isolation is actually detrimental to the firm’s realisation of superior brand performance.

	abstract = {The word innovation is widely referred to in business circles as the next level of competitive advantage. However, for many organizations today, it lacks tangibility as managers struggle with developing an innovation orientation that provides sustainable value creation. Using a mixed methods research approach, the aim and contribution of this paper is to report the qualitative findings of Fortune 1000 (F1000) organizations concerning their efforts to implement innovation agendas. Over 1100 business leaders were surveyed, which proves to be one of the largest surveys of innovation to date amongst the F1000. This article sets out to answer three basic questions as it concerns the implementation of an innovation agenda in organizations. These questions include: What does innovation mean to organizations? What has been the biggest challenges to introducing and sustaining an innovation orientation? And what has worked well in supporting an innovation orientation? What we have discovered is that leaders’ thoughts on innovation are anchored on the need for changing the status quo and trying something new. They are also particularly aware of the correlation between innovation and performance. The change theme is further echoed as the predominant barrier to change. That is, breaking the inertia of the status quo is seen as one of the top barriers to innovation. Further, our findings identified six common challenges to introducing, executing and sustaining innovation. These barriers revolve around resistance to change, organizational process, leadership, funding and resources, the external environment, and customer adoption. Finally, there are a cluster of activities that have worked well to support successful implementation of an innovation orientation in organizations. Important activities such as leadership for innovation, knowledge management, organizational structures and processes, and aligned performance management were identified by leaders as noteworthy to successful innovation. © 2015 Universidade do Porto - Faculdade de Engenharia.

The moderating effect of product life cycle (PLC) is also investigated. Using data collected from 204 manufacturers, we show that all three strategic orientations positively contribute to MC capability, both directly and indirectly through CKU. Further, our empirical findings suggest that the effects of customer, competitor and innovation orientation on MC capability are contingent on PLC. The effects of customer orientation on CKU and the effects of competitor orientation on CKU and MC capability are stronger when a product is in the maturity stage of its life cycle, whereas the effect of innovation orientation on CKU and MC capability are stronger in the growth stage. These findings suggest that to effectively improve MC capability, managers need to leverage external and internal orientations at different stages of the PLC. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

The multifaceted nature of innovation means that this approach does not contextualize the audit for the audited firms. This paper proposes an innovation audit method that identifies and formulates valuable innovation-related problems. It comprises four sequentially dependent modules which follow a structured process that allows the firm's innovation processes and capabilities to be audited. The audit was developed based on performing innovation audits with five multinational companies in the manufacturing and hygiene sectors, and nine pulp and paper companies. The paper discusses the pros and cons of different innovation audits.

Design/methodology/approach-A new research framework is developed comprising four constructs and six research hypotheses. Applying the regression model, the hypotheses were tested on data from Taiwanese MNC’s subsidiaries of manufacturing industries in Asian developing countries. Findings-The subsidiary-local supplier linkage characteristics, including economic aspect: Asset-specific investment (ASI) of local supplier and social aspect: Relational capital (RC) of local linkage, are positively associated with subsidiary’s technological capability. Moreover, the MNC’s IE can enhance the positive effect of RC on the subsidiary’s technological capability and the subsidiary’s IO decreases the positive impact of ASI on the subsidiary’s technological capability. Practical implications-This study provides useful insights into how MNCs and subsidiaries should concentrate on the factors that increase the subsidiary’s technological capability. Moreover, MNCs’ and subsidiaries’ managers must endeavor to establish long-term linkages with carefully selected local suppliers, induce these suppliers to provide appropriate ASI, and actively develop RC in the subsidiary-local supplier linkage to enhance the subsidiary’s technological capability. Originality/value-This study demonstrates that subsidiary-local supplier linkage characteristics, MNC’s IE and subsidiary’s IO can be applied to examine the technological capability of subsidiaries operating in less advanced countries. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Planning innovation orientation in public research and development (R&D) organizations presents a number of challenges exacerbated by continuous changes in citizens' social aspirations. These challenges are further amplified by the unstable and complex socio-cultural and socio-organizational characteristics of any developing economy. The paper explores and devises an adapted orientation for future innovation using a combined Delphi and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) approach, applied to a developing country, i.e. Thailand. A set of generic influencing factors for innovation management in public R&D, emerged from a non-country specific review, are refined by a three-round Delphi consultation involving experts from various Thai national research centers. These factors were further utilized to establish an AHP-based model applied to a Thai public R&D organization to investigate impacts of three hypothesized innovation orientations: "knowledge", "societal" and "commercial". The AHP-based model reveals that the "commercial orientation" has the highest impact score on innovation factors. However, a sensitivity analysis is conducted as a result of which a suggestion is made to increase the priority of collaboration-related factors to improve the impact of the "societal orientation". The findings from the combined Delphi and AHP approach have a generic dimension that can be adapted and tested in other contexts. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

The objective of the research is, therefore, to determine how the organizations' orientations (process, innovation, and technology) as critical organizational factors affect the attitude towards the use of the analytical tools of aCRM IS. Design/Methodology/Approach: To measure the orientation of the organization (process, innovation, and technology), we redesigned the existing scale, which was validated using exploratory factor analysis. In the next phase, we created a model by which we examined the impact of the organization's stance in relation to the use of the analytical tools of aCRM IS, where we used multiple regression analysis. The model was verified on a sample of Slovenian Organizations (n=105), which use the analytical tools of aCRM IS for analyzing the data they have on their customers and business partners. Results: In the study we found that all critical factors of the organization, specifically process, technology, and innovation orientation, have a positive impact on the attitudes towards using the analytical tools of aCRM IS. Innovation orientation is particularly important and has the strongest influence on the attitude towards using the analytical tools of aCRM IS. We found that innovation orientation on new ideas, methods, and approaches has the strongest effect, followed by the impact of innovation orientation on acceptance of novelty. Conclusion: The more innovation-, technology-, and process-oriented organizations are, the more positive their attitude towards using the analytical tools of aCRM IS. The study is particularly important for organizations that are introducing an aCRM IS into their business system. © 2016, De Gruyter Open Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The findings suggest that while there is no difference between small- and medium-sized firms with respect to their innovation orientations, significant differences exist between the firm's size with respect to the effect of innovation orientations on business performance. Specifically, exploitation innovation has a stronger effect on business performance among small firms compared with medium-sized firms, and exploration innovation shows a stronger effect on business performance among medium-sized firms compared with small firms.

There were made two research sets of the companies in each country. One set covers top turnover product innovation oriented companies, second set avoided product innovation orientation search criteria and covers top companies by turnover in the respective country. Each particular sample set covered 74 to 100 companies. Activities of the selected companies on Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Google+ and LinkedIn were manually scanned and particular metrics were scaled. Microsoft Excel was used for storing, statistical processing and graphic outputs of the research.

Specific aspects of climate are measured utilizing a sample of 249 managers in organizations across industries in Spain and the United States, including respondents' perceptions of collaborative communication, trust and commitment, along with the organization's orientation to innovation. A model is proposed and tested, in which collaborative communication within an organization generates trust, and these constructs are associated with greater commitment. Supported by an orientation to innovation, these variables are associated with innovation outcomes in the organization. Results showed that collaborative communication between employees builds trusting relationships, which then lead to a stronger commitment to the organization. Organizational commitment facilitates both administrative and technical innovation. Orientation to innovation is also found to partially mediate the relationship between organizational commitment and both administrative and technical innovation. Discussion and implications that guide management practices in support of innovation are presented, including the importance of fostering and rewarding behaviours associated with successful innovation outcomes that create new value for the organization. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

However, translating a hospital's innovation orientation into improved performance is challenging given that important network participants-namely physicians-may possess different aims. Grounded in Relational RBV, this study tests a model linking innovation orientation to patient satisfaction through a pathway of knowledge-sharing routines (physician partnering and customer relationship management) and complementary capabilities (hospital responsiveness). Further, this study investigates the moderating role of physician employment (a form of governance) by examining hospitals with high and low levels of employed physicians. Structural Equation Modeling results from a paired sample of primary survey and secondary data from 173 acute care hospitals in the USA reveal the following. Hospitals with high levels of employed physicians translate innovation orientation into patient satisfaction by using customer relationship management (CRM) programs to influence hospital responsiveness directly, ultimately leading to patient satisfaction. Hospitals with low levels of physician employment use CRM programs in a fully mediated fashion to inform physician partnering activities, which influence hospital responsiveness, driving patient satisfaction. © 2015 Decision Sciences Institute.},

In the hospitality context, there is little research on innovation. The purpose of this study is to understand how innovation and customer-oriented value systems can affect performance in the context of the hospitality industry. Design/methodology/approach: A comprehensive literature review is conducted to identify the major indices of innovation in the context of the hospitality industry. A self-administered questionnaire survey was used, and the target population included the managers and employees who work in the 3- and 4-star hotels of Isfahan. The sample size was 226. A convenience sampling approach was used to collect the required sample. Findings: The results of structural equation modelling indicated that customer orientation and innovativeness orientation have a significant influence on hotel performance. Furthermore, customer orientation influenced the innovativeness orientation of hotel employees. Originality/value: This paper provides a valuable insight into the measurement of innovation, customer orientation and performance in the hospitality industry and offers a foundation for future hospitality innovation research. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Buyer-supplier relationships are regarded as a source of competitive advantage, as suppliers can contribute valuable but imperfectly tradable resources. To coordinate these resources in the course of joint value creation and mitigate the risks of opportunism, buyers are required to establish transactional and relational governance mechanisms. While recent research showed that these mechanisms are intertwined with each other, little is known about the effects of different governance mechanisms in relationships with captive suppliers. Especially in case of captive suppliers, which are highly dependent on the buyer, the governance approach of the buyer affects the relationship and the supplier on a long-term base. Based on unique data of 101 suppliers in the aviation industry, we show that transactional and relational governance mechanisms exert different effects on the efficiency and effectiveness of relationships with captive suppliers. While transactional governance is primarily suited to foster buyer-supplier efficiency (e.g. cost or lead time reduction), relational governance strengthens buyer-supplier effectiveness (e.g. product customization or joint innovation). Additionally, the choice of a governance mechanism indirectly affects the strategic innovation orientation of captive suppliers. Focusing on buyer-supplier effectiveness stimulates strategic innovation orientation of captive suppliers; high buyer-supplier efficiency leads to opposite effects. Our paper emphasizes that misalignment of governance mechanisms and the objective of buyer-supplier relationships can limit strategic innovation orientation. © 2016 RADMA and John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

	abstract = {Due to the overall decrease in quality of Taiwanese universities in recent years and the resulting drastic loss of competitive advantage against foreign countries, improving the Taiwanese university system has become an urgent issue requiring immediate attention. Evidence suggests focusing on total quality management (TQM) and that innovation is the key way to effectively upgrade the operation performance and is thus highly advised. Although there are a number of measurement models for TQM and innovation, early models evaluate the performance of each element separately, making evaluation inefficient and inappropriate for practice. There is a new measurement system, the network hierarchical feedback system (NHFS), which integrates the concept and characteristics of both elements; however, the major concern is that the NHFS does not take external organization-oriented improvement into account, such as service quality in higher education, especially in innovation orientation. Additionally, due to the above dilemmas faced by Taiwanese universities, attracting more students has now been a major priority. Thus, we argue that in order to successfully attract potential students, improving TQM and innovation cannot just focus on internal organization-oriented improvement, and we further extend the effectiveness and suitability of the NHFS to a novel and more utilizable performance measurement system, the solid Inno-Qual performance system (IQPS). A hybrid model based on a decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory, a fuzzy analytic network process (FANP), an importance-performance analysis along with in-depth interviews; a fuzzy analytic hierarchical process, and a technique for order preference according to similarity to an ideal solution were adopted to complete the construction. The IQPS is the first measurement system with the most effective characteristics of TQM and innovation embedded for both new and traditional universities of different types. It is intended to enhance and evaluate performance on both external and internal organization-oriented levels, generating synergy and performance improvement. © 2012 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.},

This paper presents the validity and reliability of the items with Cronbach alpha values of between 0.8 and 0.9. Both positive and negative values like trust, honesty, and selfishness affect work practices which are presented as good reflections and measures of organisational culture. The four work practices are reliable and valid reflections of organisational culture.

The empirical results reveal performance differences across these patterns. An integrated approach leads to the highest innovativeness scores, but proactive customer-oriented innovators and top-down innovators enjoy the greatest financial success. © 2010 Academy of Marketing Science.},

A multi-level theoretical model was proposed and partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was conducted on a sample of 139 software development projects. The results suggest that: (i) individual creativity improves the quality of team decision processes, (ii) team decision processes are positively associated with four dimensions of team climate (organizational support, innovation orientation, goal orientation and informal structure), and (iii) team decision processes partially mediate between individual creativity and team climate. In particular, the obtained results stress the role of individual creativity in the formation and evolution of a positive climate by means of team decision processes. The study implies that managers should recognize the value of creative individuals as the basic source of competitive advantage and success.

Why do some firms benefit more than others from openness? A firm's strategy, which includes market and innovation orientation as well as internal structures and processes, is likely to be indicative of an adequate degree of firm openness and a well-considered selection of open innovation approaches. By analyzing 25 firms according to three proactive strategy archetypes of innovation management, we identified distinctive behaviours regarding open and closed innovation activities. The three archetypes present an adequate degree of openness, adjusted to each archetype's strategic characteristics. Innovation managers can learn from this study how to skilfully link innovation models with each other as well as which degree of firm openness may be beneficial in order to reach a desired level of innovation performance. Furthermore, they can understand which open innovation activities are characteristic of a specific proactive strategy archetype of innovation management.

These competencies are at the core of innovation in a service firm such as a hotel or a restaurant franchise. An innovation-oriented service franchise knows how to listen to its employees and customers; however, choosing which customer or employee to listen to might be paramount to finding radical innovative ideas. Learning from the past, this article investigates sources of innovation in the hospitality industry and tests the lead-user method borrowed from the manufacturing industry to extract innovative service ideas from the market before they materialize as competing market offerings. Using a downtown hotel as an empirical example, this study shows that not only are innovative service ideas present in the marketplace, but also that the best ideas most likely exist within the minds of current and past dissatisfied clients, the latter of which is often referred to as "service defectors." © 2012 International Council on Hotel, Restaurant and Institutional Education.},

	abstract = {Building on upper echelon theory and strategic process theory, this article analyzes the relationship between ambidexterity-oriented decisions and innovative ambidexterity. While ambidexterity-oriented decisions embrace the capability of top management teams to manage contradictory strategic directions, namely adaptability and alignment, innovative ambidexterity captures the ability of firms to simultaneously develop discontinuous and incremental innovations. In addition to the direct relationship between ambidexterity-oriented decisions and innovative ambidexterity, it is argued that innovation orientation and cost orientation denote two cultural implementation mechanisms that mediate this effect. Using two top-executive data sets collected in the United States (n = 83) and India (n = 78), the empirical analysis shows that innovation orientation and cost orientation partially mediate the direct influence of ambidexterity-oriented decisions on innovative ambidexterity, thus further explaining how formulated decisions made by the top management team nurture ambidextrous innovation behavior. Hence, this article extends prior literature that emphasizes a positive influence of top managers on innovation through incorporating an organizational ambidexterity perspective. Second, this study contributes to ambidexterity literature through integrating strategic process theory. While ambidexterity-oriented decisions primarily relate to strategy formulation, innovation orientation and cost orientation are associated with strategy implementation. The results show that both strategic subprocesses are vital in enabling ambidextrous innovation behavior. Third, an operationalization for the ability of top management to balance adaptability- and alignment-oriented decisions is provided based on prior literature. © 2014 Product Development & Management Association.},

Suppliers can follow different innovation strategies derived from a deliberate planning or a emerging as suppliers incrementally learn and experiment along their path. A survey of 241 suppliers illustrates that these two strategic types effect on market success depends on the level of the rigidities. The survey results also illustrate that two dynamic capabilities, the planning capability and the innovation orientation, act as intermediary variables to increase success under specific rigidity conditions. The findings further illustrate that dynamic capabilities can be enhanced by an adequate strategy. © 2011 Imperial College Press.},

Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) play a significant role in the growth of economies and in job creation, yet at the same time they can differ significantly from larger firms with respect to effective management. Recent research has examined the effects of environmental and organizational characteristics on the effective development of exploratory and exploitative innovation. SMEs differ from larger firms in many ways, such as the availability of resources, and it is unclear whether findings based on studies in larger firms will also hold true for SMEs. As such, it is important to explore and understand the extent to which SMEs differ from large firms in this important area. Specifically, this paper empirically examines the extent to which organizational factors (connectedness, centralization, formalization) and business environment (dynamism and hostility) are associated with different types of innovation orientations (exploratory and exploitative) among SMEs. © 2013 International Council for Small Business.},

We applied theory on dual allegiance to multiple targets of commitment, in conjunction with person-organization fit theory, to explore the dynamics of organizational and professional commitment among scientists and engineers working in hybrid, research-focused organizations. These types of organizations are founded on large-scale multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional collaboration between academe and industry. Using both individual- and organizational-level variables collected from 255 academic science and engineering researchers working in 22 National Science Foundation-funded Engineering Research Centers, our analyses revealed that researcher innovation orientation (i.e., the predisposition to approach work in novel ways) was positively associated with organizational and professional commitment. Those relationships were moderated by two factors: organizational productivity in late-stage technology transfer and the researcher's perceived role significance (i.e., in fulfilling the strategic mission of the organization). The strongest positive relationship between innovation orientation and organizational commitment emerged among researchers who perceived high role significance and worked in highly productive organizations. A negative relationship between innovation orientation and professional commitment also emerged among those individuals. Post-hoc analyses revealed that highly innovative, senior researchers who perceived high role significance were the most likely to report higher levels of both organizational and professional commitment. Leaders of multi-disciplinary research centers who are aware of the complexity of dynamics among organizational commitment, professional commitment, and role significance may be better equipped to effectively manage science and engineering researchers. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, resource constraints often force firms to specify one source to spread an innovation orientation. Innovation-oriented corporate culture reflects the values, norms, and artifacts shared by a large set of organisational members; conventional wisdom implies that it fosters innovativeness. In contrast, top executives' leadership behaviour drives innovations from the top; its influence on product innovation outcomes remains uncertain. This study examines the relative impact of innovation-oriented corporate culture and top executives' transformational leadership on new product frequency. In so doing, it complements the commonly applied resource-based perspective with an upper echelons perspective, emphasizing top executives as the most important predictors of the firm's strategic actions. Relying on dyadic data from 136 top executives and 414 subordinates, the results show that an innovation-oriented corporate culture is more effective in enhancing the frequency of new product introductions than top executives' transformational leadership. © 2016 Imperial College Press.},

It addresses the apparent tension between quality management and innovation management and seeks empirical support for the proposition that qualitymanagement resources can be used to support strategic innovation. Based on resource-based view, it defines key resources that firms develop during implementation of TQMsystems: TQM culture, product design capability, and process improvement capability-and assesses the role of these resources in the success of product innovation. Design/methodology/approach-A survey of 112 manufacturing firms was conducted and the resulting data were analyzed using partial least squares (PLS) to determine how TQM constructs affect strategic product innovation. Findings-The main finding suggests that only product design capability contributes to strategic product innovation. TQM culture has a direct influence on process improvement and product design capabilities but not on product innovation. The effect of innovation capability and innovation orientation on product innovation was only supported for innovation capability. The effect of innovation orientation is mediated by the development of innovation capability. Research limitations/implications-The paper focusses on the level of maturity of capability development without taking into consideration the time since adoption. Also, the measure of product innovation is based on the degree of product newness but does not dichotomize in terms of radical vs incremental. Several arguments supporting a negative relationship between TQM and innovation often refer to radical or breakthrough innovation. It would be interesting to test the model while distinguishing between radical and incremental innovation. The use of cross-sectional data is a methodological limitation. Practical implications-The results suggest that managers can leverage their quality management systems to support product innovation. In particular, the ability to design quality into products leads to higher levels of strategic production innovation. The successful deployment of TQM capabilities requires an integrative and well-structured approach, involving top leadership engagement of employees and customer orientation. While TQM culture is critical to the development of quality management capabilities, it does not directly affect the innovativeness of a firm. Originality/value-The paper explores the relationship between quality management systems and strategic product innovation. Further work is needed to test whether TQM effect on strategic innovation is different for radical and incremental products, and for other innovation outcomes such as process and service innovation. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

This study examined the influence of a number of factors on green innovation and the consequences in terms of performance. The stakeholder theory was adopted to observe the effects of each stakeholder on the green innovation practices of companies and to determine how green innovation practices influence environmental and business performance. A research model with eight hypotheses was proposed to determine the associations between the variables of interest. An empirical survey was conducted of 202 Taiwanese service and manufacturing companies. The survey found that pressure from competitors and the government, along with employee conduct, all had significant and positive effects on green innovation practices. Additionally, a moderating effect of innovation orientation existed only in the relationship between green product innovation practices and employee conduct. This study not only provides a systematic way to analyze the effects of green innovation practices but also suggests the best means for companies to adopt green innovation practices. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

For female (n = 1.522), all seven path coefficients associated with the paths linking the four antecedents to innovation orientation and paths linking the three antecedents to entrepreneurial self-efficacy are significant. For male (n = 985), four path coefficients are significant: innovation motivation to entrepreneurial self-efficacy, entrepreneurial orientation to entrepreneurial self-efficacy, entrepreneurial orientation to innovation orientation and innovation motivation to innovation orientation. Male demonstrated a significantly stronger path coefficient from innovation motivation to entrepreneurial self-efficacy (Male: β = 0.374, Female: β = 0.175) whereas females demonstrated a significantly stronger path coefficient from creativity to entrepreneurial self-efficacy (Male: β = 0.039, Female: β = 0.297).

Main variables of the research include market orientation, innovation performance, innovation orientation, technology resources and export performance. This is an applied research in terms of the objective and a descriptive-survey study in terms of implementation. Path analysis model and PLS were used to investigate the relationship among research variables and hypotheses. The data analysis and hypotheses tests show that the relationship between market orientation and innovation orientation was confirmed in the export sector of Orumiyeh Pakdis, Iran Behnoosh, and Glokozan Companies. Increasing innovation grade is resulted by increasing marketing-orientation level that leads to better export performance in the company; in this regard, the increase of innovation resources plays a significant role in innovative performance of the company; however, total factors ultimately will increase export performance directly. Generally, it can be concluded that market orientation significantly influences export performance and product innovation performance. Therefore, as a general suggestion it can be stated that by using results obtained through this practical and applied research managers of these companies can enable the organization to maintain the loyal customers by relaying on higher levels of market-orientation and innovation and consequently improve export performance of the company by implementing this strategy. © 2016, Institute of Integrative Omics and Applied Biotechnology.

	abstract = {A firm's strategic innovation orientation, which is aimed at discovering and satisfying emerging customer needs with novel technological solutions, has repeatedly been shown to be crucial for firm innovativeness and firm performance. Despite its apparent importance, relatively little research has addressed antecedents of a firm's strategic orientation that help explain heterogeneity in innovation strategies across firms. Especially the influence of top management teams (TMT) should be critical, since innovation strategies are shaped at the top management level. Building on the theory of upper echelon, this study investigates how TMT characteristics affect a firm's strategic innovation orientation, and how this relates to innovation outcomes and firm performance. Hypotheses are tested on a sample of goods manufacturers using a combination of survey data, document analysis, and objective capital market data for firm performance. Results indicate that TMT diversity, measured as heterogeneity in educational, functional, industry, and organizational background, has a strong positive effect on a firm's innovation orientation. A strong proactive focus on emerging customer needs and on novel technologies then lead to a portfolio of new products with higher market newness and technology newness, which both increase firm performance. The results therefore emphasize the importance of TMT characteristics as antecedent for innovation strategy and innovation outcomes. © 2011 Product Development & Management Association.},

	abstract = {Purpose – Ever since Sarasvathy’s (2001) seminal article, scholars have sought to test effectuation’s affect on firm performance. Although recent work has begun the arduous process of testing effectuation’s effect on entrepreneurial performance, there is still much to learn about its impact on firm performance. One such area is the relationship between effectuation and innovation. The purpose of this paper is to first, propose a scale suitable to the explication of the effectuation construct relative to innovation. Second, it proposes a more parsimonious scale for the measurement of innovation. Third, these scales are tested relative to firm performance. Design/methodology/approach – This paper develops and tests a structural model, which investigates aspects of effectuation as mediators between innovation orientation and product/service innovation. This is accomplished using a sample of 169 electronic product manufacturing-based small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Subjective measures of performance are used as the dependent variable. Findings – The three most widely used measures of innovativeness were found to break cleanly into two sub-constructs, namely innovation orientation and product/service innovation. Effectuation measures included means (who I know), leverage contingencies (experimentation), pre-commitments and affordable loss. Means and leverage contingencies were found to positively mediate innovation orientation and product/service innovation leading to increased firm performance. Affordable loss did not show a mediating role, but had a direct effect on firm performance. Research limitations/implications – This study establishes two distinct sub-constructs of firm-level innovation; namely innovation orientation and product/service innovation. Second, by testing an innovation-centric effectuation model, this research establishes an empirical relationship between effectuation, innovation and firm performance. Practical implications – Practical implications include establishing a relationship between means, leverage contingencies and innovation-performance, indicating that the ways through which small and medium-sized enterprises use their innovation networks may affect innovation outcomes and ultimately firm performance. Originality/value – This research establishes an empirical relationship between effectuation, innovation and firm performance, extending effectuation theory from the entrepreneurship to the innovation literature. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

As Chinese firms expand their production networks, their performance may improve due to their innovative use of such networks to diffuse information/knowledge. However, a survey of 171 Chinese firms found that simultaneously pursuing both central and intermediate network positions creates conflict even though both positions positively affect performance. Innovation orientation and environmental dynamics are the areas in which network position affects performance. In highly dynamic environments and for firms with innovation orientations, an intermediate position can improve performance. Conversely, central positions can improve performance for high innovation orientations in less dynamic environments. These results indicate that firms should consider the fitness of the various network positions, innovation strategies and environmental dynamics when expanding their production networks.

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to explore if, with increasing consumer empowerment, consumers are actively pulling content through a multitude of platforms rather than relying on media owners to dictate their product choices. How do media owners and content producers move toward a more reciprocal and interactive business strategy to deal with the change? Design/methodology/approach: The study was qualitative and exploratory in nature and utilized in-depth and semi-structured interviews of media consumers and experts. Findings: Consumer behavior has changed due to increased product control, in terms of type and occasion, across all income levels. The value of curatorship has increased and social media has fundamentally changed consumption patterns. Using the Berthon et al. model of response functions, we found that, content producers often suffer from inertia and operate with an Isolate strategy. The second most common approach is that of Follow or customer orientation. There is limited engagement with the innovation orientations of Shape and Interact. It is best for the industry to move toward an Interact model, accepting that consumers sometimes wish to create and at other times wish content to be effortlessly provided to them. Research limitations/implications: This study adopted a qualitative approach of industry experts and consumers within a single context. The further implications would be to develop the Interact strategy in more detail, especially toward the end of how to get media providers to change their current orientations. Practical implications: Business models of product producers in the new business environment seek to be more consumer-centric. This must not be done at the expense of an innovation orientation.

The effects were investigated comparing a sample of Chinese students to a sample of students from developed countries. Results indicate that both context factors are relevant and affect personal traits in different ways: entrepreneurial intentions and innovation orientations of Chinese students can be related to the country's transitional stage from a manufacturing-driven to an innovation-driven base, whereas the level of internal locus of control can be explained by the cultural background. Education has similar impacts on both samples and seems to reduce cultural differences. Furthermore, China's next generation of entrepreneurs is expected to have great innovative potential; however, there is a time lag to realisation, compared to that of developed countries.

The authors also explore whether this relationship is moderated by internal firm-related factors (firm age, firm size) and/or external market-related factors (market life cycle, industry type). Design/methodology/approach: The authors develop and empirically test a conceptual model using data from 396 B2B SMEs operating in Finland. Structural equation modeling is used for testing the research hypotheses. Findings: Brand orientation contributes to business growth via two indirect paths, the first one going through brand performance and the second one going through brand performance and customer relationship performance. However, although the effects are positive, the results reveal that the regression coefficients are relatively small, implying only a limited impact of brand orientation on growth among B2B SMEs. The results further suggest that firm age, firm size and industry type moderate the brand performance–business growth relationship, whereas market life cycle moderates the effect of brand orientation on brand performance. Research limitations/implications: Future research could extend this study by examining brand orientation in industrial markets simultaneously with alternative strategic orientations, such as market, technology and innovation orientation. New moderator variables should also be considered, such as market or technological turbulence. Furthermore, given that this study uses a cross-sectional data set, it is recommended that future research should attempt to test the model using longitudinal data sets. Practical implications: B2B SMEs are able to gain business growth through developing a strong brand. However, brand orientation per se appears to be of limited relevance for such an endeavor. Consequently, managers of small industrial firms should consider brand orientation only with, and in comparison to, alternative strategic orientations. Originality/value: Brand orientation has been very rarely examined from the perspective of B2B firms or that of SMEs. Interestingly, the findings indicate that the performance benefits of brand orientation seem to be smaller among B2B SMEs than what earlier research would imply. The analysis of moderation effects offers additional insights into whether there are differences between industrial SMEs as to the relevance of brand orientation. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Design/methodology/approach – This study utilizes multi-group path analysis and confirmatory factor analysis in LISREL on data from 228 firms in the Australian service sector. Findings – This study establishes that both customer and competitor innovation are positively related to exploitative and exploratory innovation. However, customer orientation does not lead to significantly stronger effects on exploitative innovation than on exploratory innovation, and competitor orientation does not lead to significantly stronger effects on exploratory innovation than on exploitative innovation. In addition, the study found that the relationship between customer orientation and exploratory innovation was stronger for family firms, while the relationships between competitor orientation and both exploratory and exploitative innovation were stronger for non-family firms. Research limitations/implications – The cross-sectional design is one weakness of this study. In addition, as firms in the present study came from the service sector the generalizability of the findings to other sectors of the economy need to be determined. Practical implications – These findings of this study highlight the need for managers to build a strong market orientation in order to promote innovation, and consider the effects of ownership structure on innovation strategies.

A total of 480 questionnaires were collected from companies in the Taiwanese electronics industry. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed to analyze the collected data. An innovation orientation was shown to positively affect supply chain integration, combinative competitive capabilities, and firm performance. Supply chain integration (in particular, supplier integration and internal integration) had a mediation effect on innovation orientation and business performance, whereas combinative competitive capabilities had a mediation effect on supply chain integration and firm performance. The results provide empirical support for the notion that an innovation orientation affects supply chain integration and firm performance. Drawing from previous studies on resource dependence theory, this study indicates how innovation orientation assists firms in integrating their supply chains and realizing the potential of the supply chain management mechanism.

Upper echelon research has concentrated on direct relationships between top management team characteristics and organizational outcomes. But recent research calls for mediating effects of the relationship between top management team characteristics and organizational outcomes. Hence, this study introduces firm innovativeness as a mediator between top management team innovation orientation and firm growth. Focusing on small and medium-sized firms, which often represent highly innovative firms, results show that firm innovativeness fully mediates the relationship between top management team innovation orientation and firm growth.

The results of this study suggest that the individual creativity of technically educated people working in group settings constitutes a predominant factor in the creative performance of its members and in the overall group creative performance. Moreover, consistent with predictions derived from previous person-environment fit studies, the innovation orientation of the organizational culture enhanced the creative behavior of groups formed by more creative individuals, but it did not significantly increase the creative behavior of groups formed by low-creativity individuals. Finally, rewards distribution rules that generate intra-group competition seem not to directly improve or impair individual creative behavior or the final group creative outcome. © 2014, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Design/methodology/approach – A qualitative study of 11 PHCs in central Sweden was conducted to classify their positions in the typology. Interviews with semi-structured and open-ended questions were used to collect the data. Findings – Four PHC types were identified by combining high and low MO and IO. This study offers insights on the importance of combining MO and IO. The overall findings show that MO and IO combination is not static and must be handled according to context. The MO-IO typology developed could be tested in a quantitative study on a larger sample of public or combined public and private housing companies. Research limitations/implications – An empirical study comparing public and private housing companies on the basis of the proposed typology in relation to economic contingencies in the environment would further knowledge in this area. Practical implications – The current study gives managers an indication of their position in the typology, which can be used as a tool for improving performance.

	abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to adopt a customercentric value creation perspective to provide insights into the contribution of business orientations, especially marketing orientation and innovation orientation to the creation of customercentric value (customer equity and brand performance). Design/methodology/approach – To undertake this examination, a model was developed and then tested to validate its applicability in the context of both developed and developing economies. The paper includes partial least squares. Findings – The findings demonstrate that being marketingoriented and innovationoriented appears to be important in creating customers, keeping them, and increasing addon selling to them and rewards the firm with greater brand performance in the marketplace. Importantly, these relationships are universally held across developed and developing business environments. Interestingly, marketing orientation was found to contribute more to the creation of customercentric value than innovation orientation in developing business environment, whereas the opposite was found in the context of developed business environment. Research limitations/implications – The data incorporate only the subjective measures of customercentric value. Future studies can use financial measures to complement the selfreporting approach used in this paper. This dualapproach to measuring the value of customers to the firm (customer equity) and brand performance would provide additional insights into the customercentric marketing literature. Practical implications – The findings suggest that managers should strive to develop a high level of marketing orientation and innovation orientation as two efficient ways to achieve higher levels of customer equity. They are also advised that if their firms are more effective in acquiring potential customers, retaining current customers, and enhancing addon selling, they see their brands perform better. Importantly, the findings also provide guidance for managers on how to allocate their resources to key business activities (e.g. marketing and innovation) in the context of international business (developing versus developed business environments). Originality/value – This study contributes to customercentric marketing theory by enhancing understanding of the contribution of marketing and innovation to the creation of customercentric value in different business environments. This study also contributes to the business orientation literature by demonstrating the utility of a culturalbehavioral approach in measuring marketing orientation and innovation orientation. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

Organizational culture (OC) has been defined as a pattern of basic assumptions that are manifested by the behavior of an organization. Positive OC is considered to be catalytic to performance enhancement. As construction aspires to be an efficient industry, this study aims to contribute in this regard by examining the relationship between organizational culture and the performance of construction organizations. Artifacts corresponding to OC identifiers and Performance indicators are short-listed from a literature review. These artifacts are arranged into constructs. The eight OC constructs are: Goal Clarity, Coordination and Integration, Conflict Resolution, Employee Participation, Innovation Orientation, Performance Emphasis, Reward Orientation and Team orientation. The performance indicator constructs are; Financial, Internal Business Process, Custom and Innovation & Learning. The artifacts were elaborated and operationalized for data collection. The constructs, as well as the OC-Performance relationship framework, were then analyzed and tested using Structural Equation Modeling. Innovation was found to be the most critical OC as far as performance of construction organizations is concerned. In today's knowledge based society, innovative organizations have proved to be the performers. This timely finding highlights the need for a culture that fosters creativity and supports innovation. © 2012 Copyright Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press Technika.},

A logistic regression analysis was performed in order to test the hypothesized relationships between stakeholder interaction, knowledge management and sustainable innovation orientation. Findings - Empirical results showed that knowledge sourced from engagement with internal and external stakeholders contributes to a firm's sustainable innovation orientation, but that this knowledge has to be managed by the firm internally in order to be converted into new ideas for innovation. Research limitations/implications - Since the present study represents one of the first attempts to characterize stakeholder-driven innovation in a quantitative way, there are some limitations related to the used database that should be addressed in future research. Practical implications - The results show the importance for companies of connecting the business functions of stakeholder engagement and innovation, and find flexible mechanisms to combine access and transformation of relevant stakeholder information.

Subsequently, how can companies sustain a long-run competitive advantage, especially in the face of increasing competition? Apart from the pat answer that innovation is critical to organizational survival, we argue that it is the innovation process and how companies manage it that forms the foundation of a resilient organization. Our research finds that organizational innovation processes take three main forms: reactive, proactive, and anticipatory innovators. It is from anticipatory innovators that resilient organizations emerge. Here, resilient organizations not only anticipate the needs of buyers but do so by creating an innovation orientation within the firm's culture. This culture-based focus goes beyond any specific innovation; it directs leaders to create an organizational culture that is receptive to innovative ideas and to the changes they produce. Here, the competitive advantage is not so much innovation per se but the organization's ability to continuously create competitive advantages based on innovations. © 2013 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University.},

Our findings suggest that self-regulation, innovation orientation, and having entrepreneurial role models (i.e., parents) predict entrepreneurial intent. Limitations and future directions for the study of youth entrepreneurship are discussed. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

The findings are based on a survey of 261 firms in the German manufacturing industry. At the operational level, the results indicate that the difficulty of the tasks to be performed by external workers influences their performance. Whilst temporary work and consulting are better suited for simple tasks with low qualification requirements, independent contracting increases firm performance when appointing individuals to perform complex tasks. At the strategic level we research effects by two strategic orientations; one generally increasing the internal innovation performance (innovation orientation), the other generally increasing the performance of external relationships (alliance orientation). The innovation orientation here reduces the negative effect of temporary work, whereas a high alliance orientation precipitates a positive effect of consulting on firm performance. This paper demonstrates that clients’ task requirements and their alignment towards innovation and alliances have a significant influence on the benefits to the firm conveyed by highly qualified externals. © 2013, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

A sample (N = 123) of undergraduate and graduate business students with full‐time jobs or the equivalent provided questionnaire data to test two initial hypotheses. It was found that four attitude‐value scales which have been used to measure change values, innovation orientation, readiness for change, and innovativenesss, are intercorrelated significantly when no distinction is made between the respondents’intentions to be innovative and respondents’actual innovative behaviour. Innovative and change attitudes, as measured by these same four scales, do consistently predict multiple innovative intentions and behaviours but not, as expected, single behaviours or single intentions. The single best predictor in a multiple regression of the combined multiple innovative intention‐behaviour measure was found to be a creative scale (R2= 0.43, p < 0.01). The innovative behaviour scale was tentatively called attitude toward being innovative. A factor analysis of this scale revealed dimensions related to innovative behaviour in organizations: the innovator, the preserver of the status quo, and the unchallenged, dissatisfied person. Two other hypotheses were also tested. The first was that the perceived organization risk‐taking climate would moderate the relationship between these attitude measures. This hypothesis was not supported by the overall results. However, moderate support was found for the hypothesis that the more formal authority a person has in an organization, the greater the consistency between change attitudes and innovative behaviours as measured by self‐report methods.

	abstract = {Market orientation and innovation orientation, including their relationship with firm performance, are well-debated in prevailing marketing literature. Interestingly, relationship orientation, as an extension of market orientation, is yet to be subjected to similar investigation. While relationship orientation suggests that firms should invest in building relationships with clients and suppliers to generate improved financial performance, innovation orientation proposes that customers will prefer superior and innovative products/services and it supports a learning philosophy. Torn between two shores, the result is often that practitioners are confused as to what the desired orientation for the firm should be. This paper considers the relationship of both orientations with firm performance in business-to-business (B2B) markets simultaneously, and in particular examines the mediating effect of innovation on the relationship orientation-firm performance relationship. By employing published scales for innovation and relationship orientation, cross-sectional data were collected from 181 business-to-business managers in South African firms. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to test for scale reliability and validity, while the hypothesized relationships between constructs were considered through structural equation modelling and partial least squares analysis. The paper provides valuable insights for measuring these constructs in an emerging market context and suggests a balanced approach to adopting these strategic orientations in B2B markets. The results suggest that practitioners and researchers should pay attention to both orientations simultaneously, because jointly they are associated with better firm performance.},

A review of the literature in this topic reveals that despite a number of organizational culture models have been developed, these are mainly for generic business settings and there has yet one developed for construction contracting organizations. This paper reports a study for this purpose conducted in Hong Kong. Firstly, artifacts of organizational culture were long-listed through a literature review. Construction professionals working for developers, consultant offices and contractors assessed the appropriateness of using these artifacts to identify organizational culture in construction. Through a principal component factor analysis, these artifacts are arranged into a seven-factor organizational culture framework. The seven factors are 'Goal settings and accomplishment', 'Team orientation', 'Coordination and integration', 'Performance emphasis', 'Innovation orientation', 'Members' participation' and 'Reward orientation'. The ANOVA result suggests no significant difference in the rankings across respondents working for developers, consultants and contractors. The relative importance rankings among these factors were also assessed according to their significance scores. The findings of the study suggest that the construction contracting organizations in Hong Kong favor culture of clear goals with stability. They are less externally focused with a relatively lower emphasis on innovation. These findings suggest construction maintains a local industry mentality. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd and IPMA.},

	abstract = {Purpose - One of the strongest convictions in marketing is that market orientation contributes to firms' performance substantially more than alternative strategic orientations such as innovation and entrepreneurial orientations. Still, some studies show that alternative orientations can also substantially affect the performance of firms, and furthermore, that firms that combine market orientation with alternative orientations are likely to perform even better than firms adopting only market orientation. Also, the nature of the relationship between market orientation and other strategic orientations is not clear. The purpose of this paper is to deal with these discrepancies in the marketing literature. It highlights the importance of the study of the relationship between market orientation and alternative strategic orientations, examines the effect of market orientation on different orientations, and identifies the orientations that are more likely to be combined with market orientation. Design/methodology/approach - The study employs a meta-analysis procedure to synthesize empirical results on the relationship between market orientation and innovation, learning, entrepreneurial, and employee orientations. Findings - Findings suggest that market orientation is strongly correlated with learning, entrepreneurial, and employee orientations, and that it has a moderate positive relationship with innovation orientation. Research limitations/implications - Research on market orientation should shift its focus, moving from the study of the direct effect of market orientation on business performance to the study of the various combinations of strategic orientations that firms can pursue in different situations, studying how the more successful market-oriented firms balance between market orientation and other strategic orientations.

The paper seeks to explore what is the core competence of the Taiwanese IT industry. In brief, what kind of intellectual capital (IC) is embedded in the Taiwanese IT industry and how this IC is managed effectively. The point is to discover how the Taiwanese IT industry should start to accumulate or enhance the core resource and strategic capability for future competitive advantage. Design/methodology/approach - The study selected a relatively representative number of IT firms in Taiwan covering six industries. This study conducted a two-stage survey to construct a measurement model and explored the IC profile of the Taiwanese IT industries. Findings - This study was able to identify eight IC factors as a measuring model in exploring the IC profiles of four Taiwanese IT industries. The findings indicate the stronger IC in the Taiwanese IT industry as well as the weaker side. Research limitations/implications - The research was limited by the sample within the Taiwan information communications technology industries. It needs to be extended across further industries in the future. It should also be compared with other countries' industrial IC under similar assessment and measurement. The significant differences between industries could be explored by case study methodology. Practical implications - Innovation capability plays an important role in confronting the knowledge-based economy in Taiwanese IT industries. However, there is no compelling evidence to show that investment in research and development will help to achieve the goal of establishing Taiwan as an "Asia Pacific Electronic Information Industry Resource Integration Center". Originality/value - This research indicates that the IC System Model developed would help us to identify the interactions among IC elements. It could help to explore whether it is true that, the higher the IC management, the higher is the influence from the input of IC to the output. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

First, we examine the influence of four key strategic marketing concepts-market orientation, innovation orientation, and two marketing capability categories (outside-in and inside-out capabilities)-on company performance. Second, these relationships are studied in three European "engineering countries:" Austria, Finland and Germany. Their relative homogeneity enables testing the generality versus context-specificity of strategic marketing's performance impact. Using SEM analysis, surprisingly weak relationships between market orientation and outside-in capabilities, and business performance are identified, as opposed to the strong role of inside-out capabilities and innovation orientation. These results can be understood through the "engineering country" characteristics. Moreover, clear differences in results are identified among these relatively homogenous countries. This is a major finding as it challenges the widely assumed generality of the strategic marketing-performance relationship. Country-specific results have also considerable managerial relevance. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Market growth is driven by product's utility increase due to technology evolution, while firms' product improvements strategies are motivated by market growth and directed by market preferences. The interdependency between utility increase and market growth makes the problem inherently dynamic. To find the dependency of utility increase on market growth, we conduct an industry and technology analysis that follows industry financial policies, innovation orientation, industry players' inter-relations and technologic capabilities. For relating market preferences and purchase intentions to product's utility, we use data collected by a conjoint study. The ability to collect and interpret data about both demand and supply aspects, before the product is introduced, leads to a pre-launch forecasting. The evolution of the cumulative adoption level over time, as a result of the technology evolution, and vice versa, is based on both customer purchase decision processes and firms' responses. We demonstrate the applicability of the model on the digital camera market. Copyright © 2010 The Berkeley Electronic Press. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {E-business is rapidly spreading in service industries. Firms that adopt this innovative way to sell or deliver services and manage customer relationships must make technological and strategic changes. Firms in the same industry adopt e-business at different rates. Why do some firms actively implement e-business, and others take a more cautious attitude? Drawing on several research streams (innovation adoption research, institutional theory, strategic orientation theory, and upper-echelon theory), this article proposes a multi-level model to explain e-business adoption by service firms. The model was empirically tested using survey and interview data from travel agencies in Taiwan. External competitive pressure, innovation orientation, financial slack, and IT resources were found to be associated with two measures of e-business adoption. CEO risk-taking propensity and firm size also had an interaction effect on e-business adoption. Interviews with CEOs indicate that most travel agencies in Taiwan are not yet ready to apply mobile technologies in their daily business. The slow progress of mobile e-business was largely attributed to the limited capacity of mobile devices and the misfit between travel product characteristics, consumer behavior, and current mobile solutions. © 2004 M.E.

This is grounded in the wealth of customers' knowledge due to their product and market experiences. Therefore, customer involvement may provide access to innovative product ideas, new technologies, market information, and development capabilities that the manufacturer lacks in-house. Whilst much has been written about the potential benefits of partnering with customers, only few researchers have attempted to document empirically the factors that foster customer involvement in NPD. This study examines the influence of relationship management tasks on customer involvement in NPD using data from more than 233 supplier-customer relationships. Our findings suggest that five relationship management tasks have a strong impact on customer involvement in NPD. Relationship sponsoring, technological consulting, information brokering, representing interests, and coordinating cooperative activities are crucial for integrating customers into NPD processes. Mutual trust and mutual commitment as well as mutual adaptations by the partner firms are further important factors for customer involvement in NPD. Based on these findings, this study discusses several theoretical and managerial implications.},

It is recommended that the orthodox orientations should be revised to the following: marketing/customer orientation; accounting/cost orientation; production/technology orientation; R&D/innovation orientation. The examination of orientation suggests they should not be regarded as mutually exclusive, but rather that organizations need, to some extent, to be oriented to all four. This treatment of orientation may be a little more complex than the former but it remains simple enough for inclusion in introductory texts. © 1993 Academic Press Limited.},

The study explores whether the degree of adoption of the aforementioned model is influenced by contingency factors such as company size or technological level. Design/methodology/approach An ad hoc questionnaire was addressed to the chief executive officers of the companies. Structural equation modelling based on partial least squares was used to test the main hypotheses of the research. Findings Firms which develop a higher organizational learning capacity put a greater emphasis on innovation. Additionally, the innovation focus of companies is positively related to the implementation of management systems which are more in accordance with the middle-up-down management model, and the degree of adoption of the aforementioned model is not influenced by company size or technological level. Originality/value The approach taken in the research serves the purpose of linking extremely abstract concepts from the middle-up-down model with specific elements from the management context. It also contributes to the development of empirical research in the domain of organizational learning, aimed at clarifying the relationship between organizational learning capacity and innovation orientation. The research contributes towards a better understanding of the degree of adoption of such a model in the Basque region, paving the way for future comparative studies which might take other regions of the world into consideration. © 2007, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

Methods: Cross-sectional study combining data from two independent surveys conducted between 2004 and 2005 in 136 public schools in Finland. The pupil sample comprised 11 583 boys and 12 706 girls from the eighth and ninth grades of lower secondary school and first and second grades of upper secondary school. A personnel survey (n 1946) was used to measure psychosocial climate indexed by trust and opportunity for participation, support for innovation, orientation towards high-quality work and accepted and clear goals. Results: After adjustment for individual and school-level covariates, multilevel analyses revealed odds for pupils' opinion of not being heard were higher in schools where personnel reported poor trust and opportunity for participation (OR 1.33) and low support for innovation (OR 1.37). Poor trust and opportunity for participation and unclear work goals among staff were associated with high truancy among pupils (ORs 1.54 and 1.39). Poor trust and opportunity for participation among staff were also related to pupils' depression [cumulative odds ratio (COR 1.14)], and physical and psychological symptoms (COR 1.17). Unclear goals among staff were associated with pupils' opinions that health education was insufficient (OR 1.40). Conclusions: school climate is associated with adolescents' health, wellbeing and received health education.},

Seafood retailers in this study operate in a concentrated industry environment where two large supermarket chains account for more than 70 percent of national food retail sales. The seafood retailers operate in a highly competitive environment, the industry is maturing, the firms are not very advanced technologically, and the sector has a disproportionately large number of firms owned and operated by persons of non-English speaking backgrounds. The results of the study indicate that incremental innovation offers substantial competitive advantages to small and medium-size firms, that incremental innovations can be adopted and operationalized rapidly by entrepreneurs with different cultural backgrounds and skills, and that small and medium-size firms that focus on sales and marketing innovations are profitable and are able to compete successfully with large businesses.},

Although the interaction effect of these two strategic orientations is conceptually recognized as a critical factor for new product's success, empirical results are mixed. This paper examines this issue in terms of innovation orientation, two types of market orientations (responsive and proactive), and new product performance. Based on a sample of 107 high-tech firms, the results of this study show that the interaction between innovation orientation and two types of market orientation yields different patterns of nonlinear responses for new product performance. Specifically, new product performance, when derived from the interaction between innovation orientation and responsive market orientation, is in the form of an inverted U, i.e., the interaction effect is contributory to firm performance until an optimal level is reached, and then the effect becomes detrimental thereafter. However, new product performance derived from innovation orientation and proactive market orientation is in the form of a U, i.e., the interaction effect is detrimental to firm performance until a threshold level is reached and then the effect becomes contributory thereafter. The different patterns of new product performance indicate that the costs and organizational learning effects of these two strategic orientation interactions are dissimilar. The paper concludes with a discussion of theoretical and practical implications of these findings. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

At the same time, in order to respond effectively to shifting market conditions, managers throughout the firm must be willing and able to disseminate and respond to market research designed to alert firms to shifts in market conditions. However, little work has focused on how creating a flexible firm orientation affects the way market research is disseminated and used. This article reports the findings of a study designed to enhance our knowledge in this area. The study suggests that firms attempting to create flexibility can lean toward an innovation orientation (encouraging new ideas) or a speed orientation (encouraging a rapid response). The study also suggests that firms which have an innovative orientation tend to use disseminated market research in a way that is consistent with the findings of the research. On the other hand, firms which have a speed orientation tend to use market research in a way that is less consistent with its findings. © 2006 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Nonetheless, retailers from emerging countries can also be important players in regional markets. The purpose of this paper is to explore how retailers from emerging markets can become strong enough to compete internationally.Design/methodology/approach - The study examines a longitudinal case study of the internationalisation process of Falabella, a Chilean retailer that has recently become an important player in the Latin America retail industry. Drawing on 32 interviews with company managers, as well as industry data and corporate reports, this paper provides insights into the successful internationalisation process of a retailer from an emerging country. Findings - The paper offers insights into emerging market internationalisation. In particular, these findings suggest that specific capabilities and resources, such as local and regional partnerships, organisational learning, innovation orientation, adaptation to the local markets, and an experienced management team, are required for emerging market retailers to internationalise and improve their likelihood of success in foreign markets. Research limitations/implications - This paper explores an underdeveloped topic through the analysis of a longitudinal case study. Thus, it is necessary to further expand this line of research and investigate other emerging market retailers.Practical implications - This study raises a number of important issues for emerging market retail managers that are reluctant to expand abroad and compete with large multinationals from developed markets, or that are struggling with their actual internationalisation process. Originality/value - To date, the retail internationalisation literature has focused on the international experiences of firms from developed nations. However, there is a gap in the literature as to how retailers from emerging countries can become strong enough to compete internationally. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

The first two of these are forms of technological innovation that are well established in the innovation studies literature. The third is a form of organisational innovation, about which much less is known. Aside from identifying statistically these three modes of innovation, we show that firms of different sizes and in different sectors have different propensities to engage in each of them. High-technology firms are, for example, the most likely of all firms to engage in the product-research mode, whilst low-technology manufacturers are the most likely to engage in the process-technologies mode. Meanwhile, the organisational-cooperation mode, which involves supply-chain rather than research-based cooperative practices, is particularly prominent in services, especially in trade and distribution services. This fits with the view that innovation in services is often 'soft', rather than primarily technological, involving organisational and relational changes within supply-chains or networks. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach – A questionnaire survey was conducted among 227 manufacturing firms in mainland China. A total of six hypotheses related to market orientation, innovation orientation, and new product success as well as moderating effects of innovation orientation and environmental variables are examined by structural equation modeling and hierarchical regression techniques. Findings – The research results show that: first, the conceptual model is superior to the popular model in Western literature in terms of model fit goodness; second, market orientation and innovation orientation have significant and positive impact, which is higher than the average level in previous research, upon new product success; third, innovation orientation and technological turbulence have a positive moderating effect on market orientation-new product performance link; and fourth, market turbulence and competitive intensity have no moderating effects. In addition, managerial implications as to how to improve product innovation performance are provided for Chinese manufacturers. Originality/value – The paper contributes to the extant literature of market orientation and product innovation in the following three ways. First of all, the research empirically validates a modified conceptual model incorporating market orientation, innovation orientation and new product performance. Second, the facilitating impact of strategic orientations (including market orientation and innovation orientation) upon new product performance is higher than the average level in previous studies (primarily based on developed economies), indicating the greater effectiveness of two strategic orientations in transition economy and east-Asian cultural context. Third, by examining the potential moderating roles of innovation orientation and environmental variables, we are able to better understand how to match market orientation strategy with those moderators in order to help enhance the product innovation performance results of manufacturing firms. © 2010, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Innovation is crucial for attaining a competitive advantage for companies. Innovation, versus imitation, motivates companies to launch new products and become pioneers on markets. Many factors have been shown to be determinants for supporting an organizational innovative orientation. One of them is organizational culture. The objective of this paper is to analyze the organizational culture that fosters or inhibits organizational innovation and imitation strategy. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses a sample of 471 Spanish companies for examining the hypotheses. Using hierarchical multiple regression analysis, it relates the effect of organizational culture with an innovation strategy. Findings: The results confirm the hypotheses. The paper finds that organizational culture is a clear determinant of innovation strategy. Moreover, adhocracy cultures foster innovation strategies and hierarchical cultures promote imitation cultures. Research limitations/implications: The main limitations are that data in the study were collected from one source for the cross-sectional design of this research. Practical implications: Managers should pay more attention to their organization culture if they pursue innovation/imitation strategies. Moreover, depending on this orientation (to be the first company to introduce in new markets or develop new products for a market versus to follow a pioneer), companies should promote different values and norms in their organizations. Originality/value: The main value of this paper is its analysis and testing of the relation of organizational culture and innovation orientation. The majority of the literature underlines the paper's seeking after organizational culture for innovation. However, this topic has not been studied in depth and requires attention to different organizational cultures and innovation orientations. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

To be innovative, Indian companies have to continuously adapt to market demands and integrate innovation within the work culture to ensure their survival in the competitive global business environment. This calls for a cultural change. The paper explains the process of developing a diagnostic tool, and examines the innovation orientation of five companies. The findings highlight the significance of reorienting the strategic posture of Indian companies to be market-driven, and to build new capabilities for delivering superior customer values. Further, the paper highlights a few strategic initiatives Indian companies have to undertake to be innovative. © 2003, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The term innovation orientation has been frequently used in the innovation literature, but with a mix of conceptualizations and meanings. Drawing from work found in the innovation, management, and marketing literatures over the past 35 years, the concept of innovation orientation as a system is conceptualized and defined in this article. The domain of innovation orientation is delineated as a multidimensional knowledge structure and a framework for understanding innovation orientation and its consequences in an organizational context are developed. The framework defines the innovation orientation knowledge structure as composed of a learning philosophy, strategic direction, and transfunctional beliefs within an organization that define and direct the organizational strategies and actions toward specific innovation-enabling competencies and processes. These innovation-oriented firm competencies are in the areas of resource allocation, technology, employees, operations, and markets. The framework then explains that these appropriately developed innovation-enabling competencies lead to innovation outcomes, specifically ideal innovation form, type, and rate that, in turn, affect firm performance. An inventory of propositions for future research that correspond to the innovation orientation concept is also presented in this comprehensive framework. This study provides two important contributions to the existing innovation literature. First, the article examines the vast innovation literature to arrive at a clear definition of the innovation orientation construct to provide a consistent conceptualization for future research. Second, the article develops a comprehensive, organized framework for understanding innovation orientation and its effects. In doing this, the framework extends the dynamic capabilities research stream by offering an explanation of how innovation orientation fosters the development of organizational competencies and makes it possible for a firm to recognize and respond to shifts in market dynamism. © 2006 Product Development & Management Association.},

Four types of businesses in the two areas were compared: Product Innovators, Process Innovators, Late Entrant Non-Innovators and Former Pioneers. Results indicate many similarities in the marketing strategy and production efficiency profiles of similar businesses across the two areas. However, there are some differences which point to a need for greater caution in attempts to transfer strategic behavior from one area to another. The greatest differences are exhibited by Product Innovators indicating a stronger influence for the environment. © 1996 by the Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The role of marketing-oriented boundary spanners in developing and maintaining successful business relationships is an area of increasing interest in both academic research and managerial practice. Drawing upon a database of 191 supplier-customer relationships, I show in this study that relationship promoters are powerful predictors of relationship effectiveness. Relationship promoters are persons who identify appropriate partners of different organizations, bring them together, and facilitate the dialogue and exchange processes between them. Relationship promoters support interactive learning processes and solve interorganizational conflicts. Furthermore, they fulfill an important social task, contributing to overcome existing distances between the partner firms, as well as developing an understanding for the situation and objectives of the respective partner. The findings also suggest that relationship promoters are especially important for the success of international supplier-customer relationships and that customer orientation and innovation orientation strengthen the positive commitment of the key persons in relationships. The article concludes with a discussion of the results and a number of theoretical and managerial implications following from these results. © 1999 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

We investigated the antecedents and consequences of team memory (both declarative and procedural) in software development projects. By examining 67 projects in the IT departments of 38 firms, we found, using PLS that customer orientation and innovation orientation was positively associated with both declarative and procedural memory, social responsibility was positively related to declarative memory, and systematic management control were negatively associated with declarative memory but positively associated with procedural memory. We also found that: declarative memory was positively related to the market success of the software, and procedural memory was positively related to speed-to-market (launching software faster) to the extent that memory was dispersed throughout the project team. Managerial and theoretical implication were further discussed. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

It is developed as sequel to a number of case studies undertaken previously, insights from which are weaved together with available literature to extend the scope of the theory. It examines what self-monitoring can inform us about the sources of tourist satisfaction and dissatisfaction, tourists’ complaining and complimenting behavior, differences in attribution, innovation orientation, and loyalty. It also provides a number of potential directions for future research. © 2004, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.},
