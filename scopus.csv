Integrating perspectives from the resource- and competence-based views of the firm and signaling theory, we posit that founders’ start-up experience and the initial presence of corporate or university shareholders can mitigate challenges associated with hiring and facilitate the recruitment of employees in the nascent stages of a firm. Moreover, we propose that early-stage hiring will be more likely in start-ups that combine such a strong set of initial competences and resources with a strategic orientation towards innovation. We find support for our hypotheses with a rich dataset of Italian innovative start-ups. © The Author(s) 2023.","Early-stage hiring; Innovation orientation; Innovative start-ups; L26; M13; O32; Resource- (and Competence-) based view; Signaling","","Agarwal R., Campbell B.A., Franco A.M., Ganco M., What do I take with me?

The study aims to examine the effect of innovation orientation and supply chain integration on structural flexibility and strategic business performance. Design/methodology/approach: Using the quantitative approach, 315 questionnaires were distributed to manufacturing firms in three cities (Accra, Kumasi and Takoradi) in Ghana out of which 305 usable responses were retrieved. The partial least square structural equation modeling technique and the statistical package for social sciences software version 27 were used for the data analysis. Findings: The findings showed that supply chain integration and innovation orientation have a strong beneficial association. A substantial favorable association between structural flexibility and supply chain integration was found in the study once more. What is more, the research revealed a strong positive relationship between supply chain integration and strategic business performance. Furthermore, the study found a strong relation between innovation orientation and strategic business performance. Originality/value: The research paper adds to the body of knowledge by examining how supply chain integration affects the relationship between innovation orientation, structural flexibility and strategic business performance. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Innovation orientation; Strategic business performance; Structural flexibility; Supply chain integration","","Adams R.J., Jeanrenaud S., Bessant J., Denyer D., Overy P., Sustainability- oriented innovation: a systematic review, International Journal of Management Reviews, 18, 2, pp. 180-205, (2016); Altindag E., Zehir C., Back to the past: re-measuring the levels of strategic orientations and their effects on firm performance in Turkish family firms: an updated empirical study, Procedia – Social and Behavioral Sciences, 41, pp. 288-295, (2012); Ambulkar S., Blackhurst J., Grawe S., Firm's resilience to supply chain disruptions: scale development and empirical examination, Journal of Operations Management, 33-34, pp. 111-122, (2015); Amegbe H., Osakwe C.N., Towards achieving strong customer loyalty in the financial services industry: Ghanaian top banks' customers as a test case, International Journal of Bank Marketing, 36, 5, pp. 988-1007, (2018); Aune T.B., Gressetvold E., Supplier involvement in innovation processes: a taxonomy, International Journal of Innovation Management, 15, 1, pp. 121-143, (2011); Baryannis G., Validi S., Dani S., Antoniou G., Supply chain risk management and artificial intelligence: state of the art and future research directions, International Journal of Production Research, 57, 7, pp. 2179-2202, (2019); Bassiouni D.H., Hackley C., Meshreki H., The integration of video games in family-life dynamics: an adapted technology acceptance model of family intention to consume video games, Information Technology and People, 32, 6, pp. 1376-1396, (2019); Berchicci L., Bodewes W., Bridging environmental issues with new product development, Business Strategy and the Environment, 14, 5, pp. 272-285, (2005); Berthon P., Hulbert J.M., Pitt L.F., To serve or create?

Consistent with a proposed “cognition-intention-action” logic, the empirical results from a sample of 633 Dutch SMEs support our predictions. SMEs that deliberately scan external information (via external knowledge acquisition practices) and distribute, interpret, and create internal knowledge (via internal knowledge-sharing practices) are more likely to enhance their innovation orientation and in turn, their innovation performance. Our study advances current understanding of innovation management, including the role of both external and internal knowledge management (KM) practices and also the value of considering innovation orientation in the overall innovation process. Our findings also offer some practical implications for SMEs to enhance their innovation ability. © 2021 International Council for Small Business.","deliberate strategy; innovation management; innovation orientation; innovation performance; Knowledge management; quantitative","","Acs Z.J., Audretsch D.B., Innovation in large and small firms: An empirical analysis, American Economic Review, 78, 4, pp. 678-690, (1988); Ahuja G., Katila R., Where do resources come from?

Precisely, the objective of the paper is to test whether the use of social media platforms positively influences ambidextrous innovation orientation in fashion companies. Design/methodology/approach: Empirical quantitative research was carried out on a sample of 853 small- to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) operating in the fashion industry in Italy. Using a logistic regression methodology, four hypotheses were tested to verify the correlation of four dimensions of social media platforms with an ambidextrous innovation orientation among fashion firms. Findings: The four hypotheses were validated: the structural dimension, the relational behaviour dimension, the cognitive dimension and knowledge transfer practices of social media platforms were proven to positively influence ambidextrous innovation orientation in fashion firms. Research limitations/implications: Though this is one of the few research studies that offers a quantitative analysis in this field, it could be further developed, for instance by extending the sample of firms to SMEs operating in other countries or by comparing multinationals with SMEs. Originality/value: This paper provides an original contribution to studies on the use of social media to promote ambidexterity in firms, which has only been studied to a limited extent in the extant literature. From this perspective, the originality of the study is further strengthened by the unique context of analysis, namely, the fashion industry in Italy. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Ambidextrous innovation orientation; Business process management; Digital transformation; Fashion firms; SMEs","","Alexiev A.S., Jansen J.J., Van den Bosch F.A., Volberda H.W., Top management team advice seeking and exploratory innovation: the moderating role of TMT heterogeneity, Journal of Management Studies, 47, 7, pp. 1343-1364, (2010); Allameh S.M., Antecedents and consequences of intellectual capital: the role of social capital, knowledge sharing and innovation, Journal of Intellectual Capital, 19, 5, pp. 858-874, (2018); Andriopoulos C., Lewis M.W., Exploitation–exploration tensions and organizational ambidexterity: managing paradoxes of innovation, Organization Science, 20, 4, pp. 696-717, (2009); Ardito L., Besson E., Petruzzelli A.M., Gregori G.L., The influence of production, IT, and logistics process innovations on ambidexterity performance, Business Process Management Journal, 24, 5, pp. 1271-1284, (2018); Armstrong J.S., Overton T.S., Estimating nonresponse bias in mail surveys, Journal of Marketing Research, 14, 3, pp. 396-402, (1977); Arribas V., Alfaro J.A., 3D technology in fashion: from concept to consumer, Journal of Fashion Marketing and Management: An International Journal, 22, 2, pp. 240-251, (2018); Arrigo E., Social media opportunities for market-driven firms, Integrating Social Media into Business Practice, Applications, Management, and Models, pp. 180-199, (2014); Arrigo E., Managing luxury brands in the digital environment, The Management of Luxury: An International Guide, pp. 245-263, (2018); Arrigo E., Social media marketing in luxury brands: a systematic literature review and implications for management research, Management Research Review, 41, 6, pp. 657-679, (2018); Benitez J., Castillo A., Llorens J., Braojos J., IT-enabled knowledge ambidexterity and innovation performance in small US firms: the moderator role of social media capability, Information & Management, 55, 1, pp. 131-143, (2018); Berman S.J., Digital transformation: opportunities to create new business models, Strategy & Leadership, 40, 2, pp. 16-24, (2012); Berraies S., Zine El Abidine S., Do leadership styles promote ambidextrous innovation?

The research method was carried out on a sample of 157 industrial enterprises in the food industry. The research process was conducted with the consideration of making these decisions dependent on the strength of companies’ commitment to several strategic issues: sustainable development, innovation orientation, and the maturity of their partnership with the customer. The results of the data analysis collected during the quantitative research show a strong correlation between the level of openness of the organization of the IR 4.0 era to RES and (a) orientation towards sustainable development, (b) orientation towards intelligence, and (c) maturity of strategic partnering with customers. © 2021 by the authors.

We first provide a theoretical background for the concept of Jupsang, which originates from the ancient literature of Sun Tsu and Lao Tsu and the modern literature of Maoism and Deng Xiaoping in China. We used a grounded theory approach to obtain five dimensions of the Jupsang concept: agility orientation, innovation orientation, vigilant orientation, market awareness orientation, and visionary orientation. Items were generated through 12 in-depth interviews in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and mainland China and were included in a questionnaire, which we used to collect data from two large forums in Hong Kong, where 440 middle and senior executives from China attended. Using SPSS Version 25 and following the scale development procedures provided by Churchill and De Villis, we found the Jupsang scale reliable and valid. This paper contributes to providing a brand new scale for strategic leadership. Practically, it can enhance the relationship between a leader and his/her followers. Finally, we provided limitations and directions for future research. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Agility; innovation; Jupsang; leadership; market awareness; scale development; vigilance; visionary","","Appelbaum S.H., Calla R., Desautels D., Hasan L., The challenges of organizational agility (part 1), Industrial and Commercial Training, 49, 1, pp. 6-14, (2017);

There have been many attempts to conceptualize and operationalize this capability. Still, they either fail to discriminate the elements that characterize IC or to present consistent, comparable elements across distinct models or frameworks. This paper reports the results of a systematic approach to formulate a firm-level IC framework. To do so, the authors conducted an extensive systematic literature review, screened 19,589 papers, and analyzed in detail 186 documents that directly address empirical or theoretical elements of IC. The researchers cross-analyzed these papers for direct and indirect references to ICs (and related concepts, such as innovation orientation, innovation competence, and innovativeness) and generated thematic categories. We drew on a hybrid approach moving between inductive and deductive coding and theme development. We adopted an ex-ante theoretical perspective of the propensity/ability axis built upon the willingness–ability approach and the dynamic capability lens. The proposed synthetizing framework is coherent with Teece's (2014) ordinary and dynamic capabilities. It comprises two sets of elements: on one hand, structural and contextual antecedents that characterize an organization's propensity toward innovation and, on the other hand, actions and resource-related capacities that act as causal mechanisms that, articulated within functions—sensing, seizing, and transforming—constitute the ability to generate innovation. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Dynamic capabilities; Innovation capability; Systematic review; Theoretical framework","","Achtenhagen L., Melin L., Naldi L., Dynamics of business models – strategizing, critical capabilities and activities for sustained value creation, Long Range Planning, 46, pp. 427-442, (2013); Adams R., Bessant J., Phelps R., Innovation management measurement: A review, International Journal of Management Reviews, 8, pp. 21-47, (2006); Adams R.J., Jeanrenaud S., Bessant J., Denyer D., Overy P., Sustainability-oriented innovation: A systematic review, International Journal of Management Reviews, 18, 2, pp. 180-205, (2016); Adams R.J., Smart P., Huff A.S., Shades of grey: Guidelines for working with the grey literature in systematic reviews for management and organizational studies, International Journal of Management Reviews, 19, 4, pp. 432-454, (2017); Ahmed P.K., Culture and climate for innovation, European Journal of Innovation Management, 1, pp. 30-43, (1998); Ajzen I., From intentions to actions: A theory of planned behavior, Action-control: From cognition to behavior, pp. 11-39, (1985); Ajzen I., The theory of planned behaviour, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, pp. 179-211, (1991); Akman G., Yilmaz C., Innovative capability, innovation strategy and market orientation: An empirical analysis in Turkish software industry, International Journal of Innovation Management, 12, pp. 69-111, (2008); Alexe C.-G., Alexe C.-M., Software solutions for the analysis of the innovation capability of the company, Procedia Technology, 19, pp. 1045-1052, (2015); Alexe C.-G., Alexe C.-M., The importance of the dimensions of the innovation management in evaluating the innovation capability of the firms in the machine building industry in Romania, Procedia Technology, 22, pp. 999-1005, (2016); Aloini D., Martini A., Exploring the exploratory search for innovation: A structural equation modelling test for practices and performance, International Journal of Technology Management, 61, pp. 23-46, (2013); Altuntas S., Dereli T., Kusiak A., Assessment of corporate innovation capability with a data-mining approach: Industrial case studies, Computers & Industrial Engineering, 102, pp. 58-68, (2016); Alves A.C., Barbieux D., Reichert F.M., Tello-Gamarra J., Zawislak P.A., Innovation and dynamic capabilities of the firm: Defining an assessment model, Revista de Administração de Empresas, 57, pp. 232-244, (2017); Alves A.C., Zen A.C., Padula A.D., Routines, capabilities and innovation in the Brazilian wine industry, Journal of Technology Management and Innovation, 6, pp. 128-144, (2011); Amit R., Schoemaker P.J.H., Strategic assets and organizational rent, Strategic Management Journal, 14, pp. 33-46, (1993); Aranda A.D., Molina-Fernandez L.M., Determinants of innovation through a knowledge‐based theory lens, Industrial Management & Data Systems, 102, pp. 289-296, (2002); Ardito L., Peruffo E., Natalicchio A., The relationships between the internationalization of alliance portfolio diversity, individual incentives, and innovation ambidexterity: A microfoundational approach, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 148, (2019); Auerbach C.F., Silverstein L.B., Qualitative studies in psychology.

Also, drawing on strands of research into early internationalisation firms, this study attempts to determine the impact of precocity and speed of internationalisation as a moderator of the relationship of antecedents to international growth. Design/methodology/approach: The research is based on answers of 748 managers from 186 firms to a self-reporting questionnaire. The partial least squares (PLS) structural equation modelling approach was used to assess the measurement and construct the model. Furthermore, the study used a PLS multigroup design with four groups of firms to compare the paths with regard to precocity and speed of internationalisation. Findings: Significant associations for seven out of eight hypotheses were found. The international opportunity recognition was found to mediate the relationship between institutional knowledge and adaptive selling-innovativeness. Additionally, the results of the comparisons found important implications to early and fast internationalisation. Originality/value: This study shows that international growth stems from individual innovation orientation. It sheds light on the importance of institutional knowledge, adaptive selling and opportunity recognition for early and pacey internationalisation. The findings contribute to the international entrepreneurship literature based on both the early and gradual internationalisation. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Adaptive selling; Early internationalising firms;

Consequently, they play a substantial role in enhancing the overall operational efficacy of enterprises. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the impact of market orientation and entrepreneurial orientation on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) operating in the Pakistani manufacturing sector. Additionally, the study sought to determine the mediating effect of innovation in the link between these orientations and SME performance. Data was collected from 381 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) operating in Pakistan using a self-administered questionnaire. Out of the total surveys collected, 360 met the criteria for conducting a detailed analysis. The study utilized a structured equation modelling technique by SMART PLS 4 to evaluate the influence of Market Orientation (MO), Entrepreneurial Orientation (EO), and Innovation (INO) on the performance of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). The findings of the study demonstrated a notable association between Market Orientation (MO), Entrepreneurial Orientation (EO), and Firm Performance (FP), wherein innovation played a crucial intermediary function within this framework. The aforementioned findings highlight the significant significance of market orientation (MO), entrepreneurial orientation (EO), and innovation orientation (INO) in the attainment of success for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This study serves as a significant reference for both scholars and practitioners who are interested in gaining a deeper understanding of the effects of market orientation (MO), entrepreneurial orientation (EO), and innovation orientation (INO) on the performance of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Therefore, this study makes a valuable contribution to the existing body of knowledge in the field, enhancing our comprehension of the topic. © The Author(s) 2024.","innovation; manufacturing firm; orientations; PLS-SEM; quantitative study; SMEs performance","","Acosta A.

This objective of this research is to develop a better understanding of the association between innovation orientation and performance. This is accomplished through a survey of registered and active Canadian NPOs. The innovation orientation approach in this study has advantages given the holistic nature and inclusion of multiple innovation determinants to measure the state of innovation in NPOs. The results suggest that NPOs with high innovative orientations have a positive relationship with the performance metrics of beneficiary satisfaction, resource attraction, peer reputation, effectiveness, and optimism in meeting future objectives. In contrast, NPOs with low innovation orientations did not present any meaningful associations with the performance constructs suggesting that innovation may not have a robust impact on performance amongst low orientation NPOs.

Paradoxically, little attention has been given to how small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) manage sustainable innovation in the current knowledge-intensive context. By studying 80 SMEs from the high-tech manufacturing sector in Italy, this research has found that, when combined with stakeholder engagement, sustainable innovation management becomes a pivotal phenomenon for new and established SMEs. Stakeholders proved instrumental in generating the sense of environmental responsibility in SMEs. As a pioneer combination of stakeholder theory and innovation management theory, our research found that stakeholder-related capabilities, both tangible and intangible, influence the firm's orientation towards sustainable innovation, its environmental responsibility and related capabilities. Our research assists the sustainability, adaptation, innovation and growth orientation of SMEs in a knowledge-intensive environment by recommending that, in their relationship with stakeholders, SMEs become more open to co-create, share and reuse environmental knowledge. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Environmental capabilities; Environmental responsibility; SMEs; Stakeholder theory; Stakeholder-related capabilities; Sustainable innovation orientation","","Agle B.R., Mitchell R.K., Sonnenfeld J.A., Who matters to CEOs?

It also explores the moderating effect of firm size on the relationship between INO and business performance. Design/methodology/approach: A purposive sample of 278 firms (manufacturing and service) was taken from the National Capital Region and the Punjab state of India. The survey questionnaire was administered to two to three managerial-level employees from each of the 278 firms. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were used to validate the INO and business performance scales. The hypotheses were tested using multi-group moderation analysis and structural equation modeling. Findings: The study shows that INO has a significant positive effect on business performance. The results have indicated that firm size (based on the number of employees) moderates the relationship between INO and business performance. However, firm size (based on investment) does not moderate the relationship between INO and business performance. Originality/value: The study is an attempt to synthesize the fragmented results testing innovation–performance relationship using firm size as a moderator on the relationship between INO and business performance and provides insights for both academicians and practitioners. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business performance; Firm size; Innovation orientation; Multi-group moderation","","Adams R., Bessant J., Phelps R., Innovation management measurement: a review, International Journal of Management Reviews, 8, 1, pp. 21-47, (2006); Agarwal S., Krishna Erramilli M., Dev C.S., Market orientation and performance in service firms: role of innovation, Journal of Services Marketing, 17, 1, pp. 68-82, (2003); Atalay M., Anafarta N., Sarvan F., The relationship between innovation and firm performance: an empirical evidence from Turkish automotive supplier industry, Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences, 75, pp. 226-235, (2013); Bedi H.S., Vij S., How do age, type, size and nature determine firms ‘entrepreneurial orientation’?, International Journal of Applied Business and Economic Research, 13, 3, pp. 1015-1030, (2015); Berthon P., Mac Hulbert J., Pitt L., Innovation or customer orientation?

An empirical analysis was conducted on two samples (scientific experts and - in the next step, business service companies). The authors applied one-way ANOVA, HSD Tukey's post hoc tests, and structural equation modelling. Approached from a knowledge-based view, this research has found that the impact of KAC on all six innovation orientation dimensions is significant and positive. This empirical evidence also supports the thesis that KAC impacts the business performance of firms. Managers should raise a company's competitive advantage by introducing an innovation orientation, which requires a high level of KAC. This study advances the literature on KAC and innovation orientation by confirming the significant impact of KAC on business performance and a firm's innovation orientation.  © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.","absorptive capacity; business performance; business services; innovation orientation; Knowledge","","Abreu M, Grinevich V, Kitson M, Savona M, Absorptive capacity and regionalpatterns of innovation, DIUS Research Report, 11, pp. 1-56, (2008); Agostini L, Nosella A, Sarala R, Spender J-C, Wegner D, Tracing the evolutionof the literature on knowledge management in inter-organisational contexts: A bibliometricanalysis, Journal of Knowledge Management, 24, 2, pp. 463-490, (2020); Al-Aama AY, Technology knowledge management (TKM) taxonomy: Using technologyto manage knowledge in a Saudi municipality, VINE, 44, 1, pp. 2-21, (2014); Ali M, Imitation or innovation: To what extent do exploitative learning and exploratorylearning foster imitation strategy and innovation strategy for sustained competitiveadvantage?, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 165, (2021); Arias-P rez J, Velez-Ocampo J, Cepeda-Cardona J, Strategic orientationtoward digitalisation to improve innovation capability: Why knowledgeacquisition and exploitation through external embeddedness matter, Journal ofKnowledge Management, 25, 5, pp. 1319-1335, (2021); Asikainen AL, Innovation modes and strategies in knowledge intensive businessservices, Service Business, 9, 1, pp. 77-95, (2013); Atuahene-Gima K, Ko A, An empirical investigation of the effect of marketorientation and entrepreneurship orientation alignment on product innovation, Organisation Science, 12, 1, pp. 54-74, (2003); Berthon P, Hulbert JM, Pitt LF, To serve or create?

This study offered a novel approach by distinguishing between novel technology convergence (NTC) and reinforced technology convergence (RTC), investigated their different effects on firm innovation quantity and quality, and examined the moderating role of science convergence. We analyzed data on published papers, patents, and other panel data of firms in China's organic chemical industry between 1998 and 2015. The results show that (a) NTC and RTC positively affect firm innovation quantity, but NTC's effect is weaker than that of RTC; (b) NTC positively affects firm innovation quality, whereas RTC negatively affects it; (c) NTC's positive effect on firm innovation quantity is strengthened by science convergence, whereas RTC's positive effect on firm innovation quantity is weakened by it; and (d) NTC's positive effect on firm innovation quality is strengthened by science convergence, while RTC's negative effect on firm innovation quality is weakened by it. By shedding light on these relationships, this study contributes to the literature on technology convergence and recombinant innovation theory, and offers valuable management implications, particularly in terms of selecting appropriate convergence strategies for different innovation orientations. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Innovation quality; Innovation quantity; Novel technology convergence; Reinforced technology convergence; Science convergence","Organic chemicals; Patents and inventions; Reinforcement; Firm innovation; Innovation performance; Innovation quality; Innovation quantity; Novel technology convergence; Reinforced technology convergence; Role of technologies; Science convergence; Technology convergence; Chemical industry","Aggarwal V.A., Resource congestion in alliance networks: how a firm's partners' partners influence the benefits of collaboration, Strat.

This study adopted a cross-sectional design and collected quantitative data using self-reported adopted scales from 213 randomly selected Batik SMEs from Kelantan and Terengganu, Malaysia. The results revealed that INO, CSO, and ABC had a positive and significant effect on the economic sustainability (ECS) of the Batik SMEs in Malaysia. The effects of SPO and NWO on ECS were positive but not statistically significant. It was found that ECS significantly and positively affected the environmental sustainability (ENS) of the Batik SMEs in Malaysia. Besides that, ECS mediated the effects of CSO and ABC on the ENS of the Batik SMEs in Malaysia. Furthermore, important performance matrix analysis revealed that the most important factors for ENS were Batik SMEs’ ECS, absorptive capacity, and INO. For the performance of ENS, the most important factors were CSO, SPO, and NWO. The Batik SMEs and entrepreneurial development programs and policies should focus on innovation and CSO as well as improving ABC to sustain in today’s competitive business environment. © 2020 by the authors.

Hence, it is critical to pay attention to their organisational performance. Organisational culture becomes a momentous measure in analysing organisational performance. As such, this study aims to explore organisational culture of international contractors. This research was quantitative based and data was collected through a questionnaire survey. It was found that client orientation is the most dominant organisation culture elements in international contractors. In contrast, technology orientation, innovation orientation and marketing formalization playing less critical role in their organisational culture. This implies that international contractors are generally lack of competitive advantage in international trade. The results indirectly explain the importance of international joint venture and partnering especially in developing countries. Yet, they are not an ineffective way to improve organisational performance, instead, a competitive culture is critical. As such, the role of top management and cultural reformation are important to counteract the uncompetitive culture. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Contractors; developing countries; international construction; international organisations; Malaysia; organisational culture","","Abdul-Aziz A.R., Global strategies: a comparison between Japanese and American construction firms, Construct Manage Econ, 12, 6, pp. 473-484, (1994); Ahmed S.M., Azhar S., Risk management in the Florida construction industry.

However, not all firms are equally capable of doing so. To improve our understanding of how firms can better achieve such innovation ambidexterity, we develop a framework investigating the joint effects of intellectual capital, dynamic capabilities, and innovation orientation on innovation ambidexterity. We empirically assess this framework using time-lagged, multi-source data from the pharmaceutical industry. The results suggest that intellectual capital positively relates to innovation ambidexterity through dynamic capabilities. We further find that firms with an innovation orientation are more likely to leverage dynamic capabilities to drive innovation ambidexterity. This study contributes to literature on intellectual capital and innovation ambidexterity, and offers managers insights on how to align their knowledge practices to develop dynamic capabilities when pursuing innovation ambidexterity. © 2022 The Authors","Dynamic capability; Innovation ambidexterity; Innovation orientation; Intellectual capital; Pharmaceutical industry","","Altintas G., Ambrosini V., Dynamic Managerial Capabilities, (2019); Anand J., Oriani R., Vassolo R.S., Alliance Activity as a Dynamic Capability in the Face of a Discontinuous Technological Change, Organization Science, 21, 6, pp. 1213-1232, (2010); Andriopoulos C., Lewis M.W., Exploitation-exploration tensions and organizational ambidexterity: Managing paradoxes of innovation, Organization Science, 20, 4, pp. 696-717, (2009); Andonova V., Losada-Otalora M., Understanding the interplay between brand and innovation orientation: Evidence from emerging multinationals, Journal of Business Research, 119, 3, pp. 540-552, (2020); Ardito L., Besson E., Messeni Petruzzelli A., Gregori G., The influence of production, IT, and logistics process innovations on ambidexterity performance, Business Process Management Journal, 24, 5, pp. 1271-1284, (2018); Ardito L., Messeni Petruzzelli A., Dezi L., Castellano S., The influence of inbound open innovation on ambidexterity performance: Does it pay to source knowledge from supply chain stakeholders?, Journal of Business Research, 119, pp. 321-329, (2020); Aribi A., Dupouet O., The role of organizational and social capital in the firm's absorptive capacity, Journal of Knowledge Management, 19, 5, pp. 987-1006, (2015); Asiaei K., Barani O., Bontis N., Arabahmadi M., Unpacking the black box How intrapreneurship intervenes in the intellectual capital-performance relationship?, Journal of Intellectual Capital, 21, 6, pp. 809-834, (2020); Ayuso S., Rodriguez M.A., Garcia-Castro R., Arino M.A., pp. 1399-1417, (2011); Beltramino N.S., Garcia-Perez-de-Lema D., Valdez-Juarez L.E., The structural capital, the innovation and the performance of the industrial SMES, Journal of Intellectual Capital, 21, 6, pp. 913-945, (2020); Benner M.J., Tushman M.L., Reflections on the 2013 Decade Award – “Exploitation, exploration, and process management: The productivity dilemma revisited” ten years later, Academy of Management Review, 40, 4, pp. 497-514, (2015); Birkinshaw J., Zimmermann A., Raisch S., How Do Firms Adapt to Discontinuous Change?

This study further investigates strategic orientation (customer, competitor, and innovation orientation) and focuses on the effect of strategic orientation on EMSs and eco-innovation; it also examines the mediating role of EMSs in the relationship between strategic orientation and eco-innovation. Furthermore, this study investigates the moderating role of absorptive capacity in the relationship between strategic orientation and EMSs. Reliability and validity analyses of a sample of 142 respondents indicated that the study design was effective, consistent, and reliable. The findings indicate that (1) strategic orientation (competitor and innovation orientation) positively influences EMSs, (2) EMSs positively influence eco-innovation, (3) absorptive capacity-enhancing strategic orientation positively influences EMSs, and (4) EMS intermediary strategic orientation positively influences eco-innovation. This study contributes to the theoretical understanding of why some firms exhibit greater proactivity in EMSs than others do. © 2021 by the authors.

Design/methodology/approach: Data from 211 valid cases were gathered through an online survey and face-to-face interviews with Albanian tourism firms. Structural equation modeling was implemented to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings: The results suggest that HR training has a positive influence on innovativeness, which in turn affects positively firm performance. Thus, there is a mediation effect of innovativeness in the link between training and performance. Research limitations/implications: The findings are in line with the strategic perspective on HR management, which suggests that HR practices are likely to indirectly affect firm performance. However, results should be interpreted with caution due to the cross-sectional nature of the data. Practical implications: HR training practices may help tourism firms to increase their innovation orientation and ultimately improve their performance outcomes. Originality/value: Investigating the mediation role of innovativeness on the relationship between skill-enhancing HR practices and firm performance within the tourism context is the core contribution. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Firm performance;

Given the importance of dynamic capabilities in today's economy, the purpose of this study is to understand the role of strategic flexibility as a dynamic capability in the development of organisational capabilities. This study aims to explore the indirect effect between strategic flexibility and firm performance through three organisational capabilities: organisational learning, entrepreneurship and innovation orientation in SMEs. In order to test the conceptual model, we conducted quantitative research using survey data from 180 SMEs. The contributions are twofold. First, we developed a unique and distinctive model to assess the indirect relationship between strategic flexibility and firm performance. Second, we realised the value of organisational learning as a mediating variable as it strengthens the relationship between strategic flexibility and firm performance.  © 2023 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","dynamic capabilities; entrepreneurship; firm performance; innovation orientation; organisational learning","","Abbott A., Banerji K., Strategic flexibility and firm performance: the case of US based transnational corporations, Global Journal of Flexible Systems Management, 4, 1-2, pp. 1-8, (2003); Altinay L., Madanoglu M., De Vita G., Arasli H., Ekinci Y., The interface between organizational learning capability, entrepreneurial orientation, and SME growth, Journal of Small Business Management, 54, 3, pp. 871-891, (2015); Bagozzi R., Yi Y., On the evaluation of structural equation models, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Sciences, 16, pp. 74-94, (1988); Baregheh A., Rowley J., Sambrook S., Towards a multidisciplinary definition of innovation, Management Decision, 47, 8, pp. 1323-1339, (2009); Barreto I., Dynamic capabilities: a review of past research and an agenda for the future, Journal of Management, 36, 1, pp. 256-280, (2010); Baum J., Wally S., Strategic decision speed and firm performance, Strategic Management Journal, 24, 11, pp. 1107-1129, (2003); Bierwerth M., Schwens C., Isidor R., Kabst R., Corporate entrepreneurship and performance: a meta-analysis, Small Business Economics, 45, 2, pp. 255-278, (2015); Bishwas S., Sushil, LIFE: an integrated view of meta organizational process for vitality, Journal of Management Development, 35, 6, pp. 747-764, (2016); Bradley S., Shepherd D., Wiklund J., The importance of slack for new organizations facing 'tough' environments, Journal of Management Studies, 48, 5, pp. 1071-1097, (2011); Brown T., Davidsson P., Wiklund J., An operationalization of Stevenson's conceptualization of Entrepreneurship as opportunity-based firm behavior, Strategic Management Journal, 22, 10, pp. 953-968, (2001); Brozovic D., Strategic flexibility: a review of the literature, International Journal of Management Reviews, 20, 1, pp. 1-29, (2016); Chaudhary S., Implications of strategic flexibility in small firms: the moderating role of absorptive capacity, South Asian Journal of Business Studies, 8, 3, pp. 370-386, (2019); Chien S., Tsai C., Dynamic capability, knowledge, learning, and firm performance, Journal of Organizational Change Management, 25, 3, pp. 434-444, (2012); Chiva R., Alegre J., Organizational learningand organizational knowledge, Management Learning, 36, 1, pp. 49-68, (2005); Chiva R., Alegre J., Organizational learning capability and job satisfaction: an empirical assessment in the ceramic tile industry, British Journal of Management, 20, 3, pp. 323-340, (2009); Chiva R., Ghauri P., Alegre J., Organizational learning, innovation and internationalization: a complex system model, British Journal of Management, 25, 4, pp. 687-705, (2013); Crossan M., Lane H., White R., An organizational learning framework: from intuition to institution, Academy of Management Review, 24, 3, pp. 222-537, (1999); Dias A., Renato P., Dynamic capabilities and marketing capabilities in Portugal, Academia Revista Latinoamericana de Administración, 30, 3, pp. 417-430, (2017); Dias A., Manuel E.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the mediating role of competitive advantage in the relationship between strategic orientation and economic sustainability under unpredictable circumstances. This study collected quantitative data from a total of 284 halal small and medium enterprises (SMEs) from Indonesia through structured interviews. Data were analysed using partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). Moreover, this study adopted artificial neural network (ANN) analysis for a model-free estimation using non-linear, multilayer, and parallel regression. The results revealed statistically significant and positive effect of strategic orientation on economic sustainability. Additionally, this study found that competitive advantage expanded the effect of strategic orientation on economic sustainability. Findings of ANN analysis confirm high prediction accuracy of the model. Findings of the sensitivity analysis highlighted the importance of innovation, network and technological orientation, and the positive effect of competitive advantage on halal SMEs economic sustainability. In order to achieve long-term economic sustainability, halal SMEs should therefore focus on innovation capacity, vertical and horizontal networking and adoption of the latest technologies. The uniqueness of this study focused on the strategic orientation and value of competitive advantage of halal SMEs towards economic sustainability. Additionally, this study was the first to develop hybrid SEM–neural network analysis to apply sensitivity analysis for the evaluation of the contribution of each exogenous predictor towards the endogenous construct. © 2022, The Author(s).","Competitive advantage; Competitor orientation; Consumer orientation; Economic sustainability; Innovation orientation; Network orientation; Technology orientation","","Ahashan Md H., Bao Y., Nabi N., Dulal M., Ansary A.A., Islam M., Impact of strategic orientations on the implementation of green supply chain management practices and sustainable firm performance, Sustainability, (2021); Al-Idrus S., Abdussakir A., Djakfar M., The effect of entrepreneurial orientation and technology orientation on market orientation with education as moderation variable, Management Science Letters, 10, 10, pp. 2343-2350, (2020); Andonova V., Losada-Otalora M., Understanding the interplay between brand and innovation orientation: Evidence from emerging multinationals, Journal of Business Research, 119, pp. 540-552, (2020); Anning-Dorson T., Innovation and competitive advantage creation: The role of organisational leadership in service firms from emerging markets, International Marketing Review, 35, 4, pp. 580-600, (2018); Anwar M., Rehman A.U., Shah S.Z.A., Networking and new venture’s performance: Mediating role of competitive advantage, International Journal of Emerging Markets, 13, 5, pp. 998-1025, (2018); Ardito L., Dangelico R.M., Firm environmental performance under scrutiny: The role of strategic and organizational orientations, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 25, 4, pp. 426-440, (2018); Barney J., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage, Journal of Management, 77, 1, pp. 99-120, (1991); Barney J.B., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage, Economics meets sociology in strategic management advances in strategic management, 17, pp. 203-227, (2000); Barney J.B., Hesterly W.S., Administração estratégica e vantagem competitiva, (2007); Barney J.B., Mackey A., Text and metatext in the resource-based view, Resource Management Journal, 26, pp. 369-378, (2016); Barney J.B., Wright M., Ketchen D.J., The resource-based view of the firm: Ten years after 1991, Journal of Management, 27, pp. 625-641, (2001); Becker G.S., Human capital, (1964); Borgatti S.P., Foster P.C., The network paradigm in organizational research: A review and typology, Journal of Management, 29, 4, pp. 511-532, (2003); Bouncken R.B., Koch T.T., Innovation strategy explored: Innovation orientation’s strategy preconditions and market performance outcomes, Zeitschrift Für Betriebswirtschaft, 77, 2, pp. 19-43, (2007); Carayannis E.G., Campbell D.F.J., Triple helix, quadruple helix and quintuple helix and how do knowledge, innovation and the environment relate to each other?

Design/methodology/approach: Probability sampling technique, particularly, simple random method, was used for this study. Approximately, 81% response rate was achieved from a total sample size of 346. Furthermore, PLS-SEM technique was used to determine the relationships among the study variables. Findings: The result showed that market innovation significantly predicted SMEs’ performance. Conversely, non-significant positive nexus was established between process innovation and SMEs’ performance as well as product innovation and SMEs’ performance. Practical implications: Based on the outcome, the stakeholders in the SME sector should aim at improving their market, products and process innovations. Originality/value: Despite the importance attached to the employment of innovation in the SME sector by scholars in the extant literature, studies involving dimensions of innovation orientation on SMEs’ performance were not much seen in literature. This study enriched literature by determining the relationships between the innovation orientation dimensions and SMEs’ performance. © 2021, Kassimu Issau, Innocent Senyo Kwasi Acquah, Robert Ipiin Gnankob and Zulaiha Hamidu.","Ghana; Innovation orientation; Manufacturing sector; Performance; PLS-SEM; SMEs","","Abor J., Quartey P., Issues in SME development in Ghana and South Africa, International Research Journal of Finance and Economics, 39, 6, pp. 215-228, (2010); Afriyie S., Duo J., Appiah K., Musah A.I., The nexus between types of innovation and marketing performance of SME in an emerging economy, International Review of Management and Marketing, 8, 6, (2018); Aksoy M., Benzene carcinogenicity, Benzene carcinogenicity, pp. 119-158, (2017); Aminu I.M., Shariff M.N.M., Influence of strategic orientation on SMEs access to finance in Nigeria, Asian Social Science, 11, 4, (2015); Anderson C., Free: the future of a radical price, (2009); Appiah-Adu K., Singh S., Customer orientation and performance: A study of SMEs, Management Decision, 36, 6, (1998); Ashok M., Narula R., Martinez-Noya A., How do collaboration and investments in knowledge management affect process innovation in services?, Journal of Knowledge Management, 20, 5, pp. 1004-1024, (2016); Augustine J., Wudyka S., Durkin W., Kleis S., U.S. Patent No. 8,257,328., (2012); Barney J., Special theory forum the resource-based model of the firm: Origins, implications, and prospects, Journal of Management, 17, 1, pp. 97-98, (1991); Bigliardi B., Domio A.I., An empirical investigation of innovation determinants in food machinery enterprises, European Journal of Innovation Management, 12, 2, (2009); Boer H., During W.E., Innovation, what innovation?

The research stream is evolving to include the exploration of the practices of companies with high innovation orientations but remains limited. This study explores the innovation orientation and performance relationship, the practices of companies with high innovation orientations, and the differences in innovation orientation scores of companies across the world. Based on insight from 1265 companies in nine countries, this research confirms the innovation orientation and performance relationship in a global context, identifies crowdsourcing, open innovation, design thinking, stage-gate systems, scientific discovery, big data analytics, measuring innovation, and innovation management software as common practices of high innovators, and shows that companies' innovation orientation dimensions and overall scores differ based on country. It offers an extensive and global perspective to the research and provides managerial considerations for executives seeking to enhance firm-level innovativeness, corporate performance, and economic prosperity. © 2022 The Authors","Global study; Innovation culture; Innovation orientation; Novel methodologies and technologies","Information management; Design thinking; Global context; Global study; Innovation Culture; Innovation design; Innovation orientation; Novel methodology; Novel methodology and technology; Open innovation; Performance; global perspective; industrial performance; industrial technology; innovation; management practice; Data Analytics","Akgun A.E., Keskin H., Byrne J.C., Aren S., Emotional and learning capability and their impact on product innovativeness and firm performance, Technovation, 27, 9, pp. 501-513, (2007); Asakawa K., Nakamura H., Sawada N., Firms' open innovation policies, laboratories' external collaborations, and laboratories' R&D performance, R&D Manag., 40, 2, pp. 109-123, (2010); Bayus B.L., Erickson G., Jacobson R., The financial rewards of new product introductions in the personal computer industry, Manag.

Not surprisi ngly, the adoption of innovations has emerged as one of the dominant research topics in the management of innovations in organizations, though investigations often yield mixed results. However, innovation is still considered a hallmark of big companies only. This study aims to hint the gap of knowledge related to the association between the owners and managers’ personality traits and innovation orientation of small business. The empirical research includes data from two hundred small businesses in different branches of industry. The results interestingly showed that high levels of both conscientiousness and extraversion among owners/managers have positive, but insignificant, impacts on the performance of their small enterprises. The knowledge acquired is critical to organizational innovation and yields lessons that can be used to transform how individual contributors are leveraged within organizations. Implications for practice are also discussed. © Journal of Management World, 2023.","Entrepreneurship; Innovation Management; Management of Technology and Innovation; Personal Involvement","","Abd Aziz N.A., Hanafiah M.H., Comparison study between family business franchisee and non-family business Franchisee, Journal of Contemporary Issues and Thought, 10, 1, pp. 17-26, (2020); Ali M., Park K., The mediating role of an innovative culture in the relationship between absorptive capacity and technical and non-technical innovation, Journal of Business Research, 69, 5, pp. 1669-1675, (2016); Alsaad A.K., Yousif K.J., AlJedaiah M.N., Collaboration: The key to gain value from IT in supply chain, EuroMed Journal of Business, 13, 2, pp. 214-235, (2018); Anderson P., Tushman M.L., Technological discontinuities and dominant designs: A cyclical model of technological change, Administrative Science Quarterly, 35, 4, pp. 604-633, (1990); Baregheh A., Rowley J., Sambrook S., Towards a multidisciplinary definition of innovation, Management Decision, 47, 8, pp. 1323-1339, (2009); Baron R.A., Tang J., The role of entrepreneurs in firm-level innovation: Joint effects of positive affect, creativity, and environmental dynamism, Journal of Business Venturing, 26, 1, pp. 49-60, (2011); Baumol W.J., Education for innovation: Entrepreneurial breakthroughs versus corporate incremental improvements, Innovation Policy and the Economy, 5, 1, pp. 33-56, (2005); Bedford D.S., Bisbe J., Sweeney B., Performance measurement systems as generators of cognitive conflict in ambidextrous firms, Accounting, Organizations and Society, 72, pp. 21-37, (2019); Benner M.J., Tushman M., Process management and technological innovation: A longitudinal study of the photography and paint industries, Administrative Science Quarterly, 47, 4, pp. 676-707, (2002); Bianchi M., Campodall'Orto S., Frattini F., Vercesi P., Enabling open innovation in small-and medium-sized enterprises: How to find alternative applications for your technologies, R&D Management, 40, 4, pp. 414-431, (2010); Bigliardi B., Galati F., An open innovation model for SMEs, Researching open innovation in SMEs, pp. 71-113, (2018); Bjork J., Boccardelli P., Magnusson M., Ideation capabilities for continuous innovation, Creativity and Innovation Management, 19, 4, pp. 385-396, (2010); Bobko P., Roth P.L., Buster M.A., The usefulness of unit weights in creating composite scores, a literature review, application to content validity, and meta-analysis, Organizational Research Methods, 10, 4, pp. 689-709, (2007); Bommer M., Jalajas D.S., Innovation sources of large and small technology-based firms, IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, 51, 1, pp. 13-18, (2004); Bosua R., Evans N., Extending social capital through online social networks (OSNs) in rural Australian SMEs, ICIS 2017 Proceedings, (2017); Bouncken R., Ratzmann M., Barwinski R., Kraus S., Coworking spaces: Empowerment for entrepreneurship and innovation in the digital and sharing economy, Journal of Business Research, 114, pp. 102-110, (2020); Caloghirou Y., Kastelli I., Tsakanikas A., Internal capabilities and external knowledge sources: Complements or substitutes for innovative performance?, Technovation, 24, 1, pp. 29-39, (2004); Cardoni A., Dumay J., Palmaccio M., Celenza D., Knowledge transfer in a start-up craft brewery, Business Process Management Journal, 25, 1, pp. 219-243, (2018); Carland J.W., Hoy F., Boulton W.R., Carland J.A.C., Differentiating entrepreneurs from small business owners: A conceptualization, Academy of Management Review, 9, 2, pp. 354-359, (1984); Carson D., Some exploratory models for assessing small firms’ marketing performance (a qualitative approach), European Journal of Marketing, 24, 11, pp. 8-51, (1990); Innovation in the business sector 2006-2008, (2012); Chesbrough H.W., Open innovation: The new imperative for creating and profiting from technology, (2003); Chung D., Kim M.J., Kang J., Influence of alliance portfolio diversity on innovation performance: The role of internal capabilities of value creation, Review of Managerial Science, 13, 5, pp. 1093-1120, (2019); Cliff J.E., Does one size fit all?

We also investigate the moderating effects of cluster relationships on this relationship. Using a sample of 638 SMEs in four industry clusters in Tianjin, China, we confirm an inverted U-shaped correlation between a firm's relative innovation orientation and performance, and explicate the latent mechanisms underlying such an inverted U shape. We find that the number and strength of a firm's cluster relationships can moderate this inverted U-shaped curve: the former moves the turning point of the inverted U shape toward exploratory orientation, and the latter moves the turning point toward exploitative orientation. For improved performance, we discuss appropriate innovation balancing strategies for cluster firms with different cluster relationships, and optimal cluster strategies under different innovation-balancing conditions. This study adds to the increasing scholarly effort on latent mechanisms behind U-shaped relationships and moderating effects on such relationships in management research.

The present study addresses this knowledge gap by developing a strategic roadmap that explains how businesses can leverage Industry 4.0 technologies to introduce sustainability into innovative practices. For this purpose, the study conducts a systematic review of extant literature to identify Industry 4.0 functions for sustainable innovation and applies interpretive structural modeling to devise the promised roadmap. The results offer interesting insights into Industry 4.0 applications for sustainable innovation. The strategic roadmap developed reveals that Industry 4.0 enables sustainable innovation through 11 functions. Industry 4.0 and the underlying digital technologies and principles allow businesses to improve interfunctional collaboration and better integrate with internal and external stakeholders. Industry 4.0 further improves the knowledge base and advanced manufacturing competency and promotes organizational capabilities valuable to sustainable innovation such as green absorptive capacity, sustainable partnership, and sustainable innovation orientation. Through these functions, Industry 4.0 subsequently enhances green process innovation capacity and the ability to develop or reintroduce eco-friendly products economically and competitively. Overall, the roadmap explains the complex precedence relationships among the 11 sustainable innovation functions of Industry 4.0, offering important implications for businesses that seek to leverage Industry 4.0 sustainability implications and manage sustainable development. © 2021 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","digitalization;

This global study of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) adds depth to current research because it explores how innovative methodologies and technologies impact the relationship between IO and performance. Our results from 437 companies show that IO enhances firm performance, but only some of the innovative methodologies and technologies explored (crowdsourcing, open innovation, innovation management software, scientific discovery, and prototypes) enhance firm performance.

They need to acquire capabilities to perform within networks of professional and social relations with other organizations. However, network relationships are often insufficient due to lack of sustainability in network capability. This multidimensional concept involves four components: coordination, relational skills, partner knowledge, and internal communication. This study proposes a new dimension related to the collaborative environmental relationship. This component addresses an enterprise’s ability to enhance environmental collaboration, share knowledge, and increase environmental awareness. This study, therefore, suggests testing and comparing the five-dimensional scale of network capability with the existing four-dimensional scale, and examining its impact on eco-innovation capability and sustainable performance. This has not been tested previously. Using partial least squares path modelling, this study tests a set of hypothesised relationships that focus on a sample of 237 Tunisian enterprises. The findings reveal that: (1) the sample supports measurement properties of the updated network capability and indicates that the new dimension in network capability research and sustainable development is important and can be added to the finalised network capability construct, (2) network capability, with the updated five dimensions, directly and positively influences eco-innovation capability and sustainable performance, and the impacts are more effective than in the previous four-dimensional construct, and (3) eco-innovation mediates the relationship between network capability with the updated five dimensions and enterprises’ sustainable performance, and the impact is more effective than in the previous four-dimensional construct. Therefore, our study will help strengthen the enterprise’s performance in promoting sustainable development.

This study focuses on the holistic understanding of stakeholder interests and introduces the organizational capability of stakeholder understanding, defined as the degree to which a firm understands its stakeholder system. In particular, this study empirically examined the antecedents and consequences of stakeholder understanding in a green product innovation context. Through a two-stage survey approach, data were collected from 181 innovation professionals working in United States based manufacturing firms. Using hierarchical regression analysis, hypotheses about antecedents and consequences of stakeholder understanding are tested. Results show that stakeholder understanding is higher in firms with high innovation orientation, and lower in environments with high complexity. Results also show that stakeholder understanding has positive effects on three types of firm performance: green performance, market performance, and firm innovativeness. In addition, results of piecewise linear regression reveal that only for firms that exceed the median level of green orientation there is a positive relationship between green orientation and stakeholder understanding. The study's implications are that stakeholder understanding is a relevant capability for firms that aim to develop better and greener product innovations. To obtain stakeholder understanding, firms should strive for innovation and excel in green orientation, because only for truly green firms, green orientation helps to develop stakeholder understanding. © 2023 The Authors","Complexity; Firm innovativeness; Green orientation; Green product innovation; Stakeholder understanding","Regression analysis; Complexity; Firm innovativeness; Green orientation; Green product innovation; Green products; Innovativeness; Performance; Product innovation; Stakeholder interest; Stakeholder understanding; Piecewise linear techniques","Ackoff R., The systems revolution, Long.

Innovation orientation has been commonly used to assess an organization's innovative culture. To date, most innovation orientation research has explored its relationship with performance. However, the literature is unclear as to what innovative companies do differently to achieve superior performance. This study advances innovation orientation research by examining differing business practices of high versus low innovative Japanese firms. The various business practices include culture management, open innovation, analytics, innovation management software, crowdsourcing, design thinking, measuring innovation, stage-gate, and scientific discovery. Using data from 261 Japanese firms, this study finds that high innovators, as compared to low innovators, are more likely to engage in many of these business practices. Until this study, some of these business practices were not empirically shown to be correlated with high innovators, much less explored in the same study. This paper also offers a stepwise approach for executives seeking to enhance competitiveness via innovation. Specifically, executives should first look to creating an innovation orientation and subsequently implement such business practices. © 2021 The Authors","Innovation; Innovation orientation; Innovation stategy; Japan","","Ahmed P., Culture and climate for innovation, European Journal of Innovation Management, 1, 1, pp. 30-42, (1998); Aiman-Smith L., Goodrich N., Roberts D., Scinta J., Assessing your organization's potential for value innovation, Research-Technology Management, 48, 2, pp. 37-42, (2005); Alavi M., Leidner D.E., Knowledge management and knowledge management systems: Conceptual foundations and research issues, MIS Quarterly, 25, 1, pp. 107-136, (2001); Aldrich H., Herker D., Boundary spanning roles and organization structure, Academy of Management Review, 2, 2, pp. 217-230, (1977); Amit R., Schoemaker P.J., Strategic assets and organizational rent, Strategic Management Journal, 14, 1, pp. 33-46, (1993); Anderson R.E., Can stage-gate systems deliver the goods?, Financial Executive, 9, 6, pp. 34-38, (1993); Anderson N.R., West M.A., Measuring climate for work group innovation: Development and validation of the team climate inventory, Journal of Organizational Behavior, 19, 3, pp. 235-258, (1998); Argote L., Organizational Learning: Creating, retaining, and transferring knowledge, (1999); Asakawa K., Nakamura H., Sawada N., Firms' open innovation policies, laboratories' external collaborations, and laboratories' R&D performance, R & D Management, 40, 2, pp. 109-123, (2010); Barney J., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage, Journal of management, 17, 1, pp. 99-120, (1991); Berman S.J., Digital transformation: Opportunities to create new business models, Strategy & Leadership, 40, 2, pp. 16-24, (2012); Blumentritt T., Danis W.M., Business strategy types and innovative practices, Journal of Managerial Issues, 18, 2, pp. 274-291, (2006); Boerner S., Eisenbeiss S.A., Griesser D., Follower behavior and organizational performance: The impact of transformational leaders, Journal of Leadership & Organizational Studies, 13, 3, pp. 15-26, (2007); Booz, New products management for the 1980s, (1982); Brockman B.K., Morgan R.M., The role of existing knowledge in new product innovativeness and performance, Decision Sciences, 34, 2, pp. 385-419, (2003); Brown T., Design thinking, Harvard Business Review, 86, 6, pp. 3-10, (2008); Cameron K.S., Quinn R.E., Diagnosing and changing organizational culture.

Much research on innovation ecosystems has examined high technology firms and locations and has used interview, survey, or science and technology data methods. Our study focuses on a resource-based ecosystem—agri-food in a medium-sized region—and explores a novel method using media sources to identify ecosystem links. We use this method to capture the innovation ecosystem around two plant-based protein firms and a conventional food processor in Winnipeg, Canada. We extract organisational actors from the full text of business and news articles, link co-occurring actors in social networks, and use modularity partitioning to detect communities in these networks. Our results show that the focal agri-food firms vary in their ecosystem associations, with little duplication in the actor organisations across the different firms’ networks. The plant-based protein firm networks had a greater innovation orientation than was noticeable in the established food producer’s network, particularly with industry and civic association intermediaries, government, and other agricultural companies. Insights from using the method and implications of the findings are discussed. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","agri-food; Canada; Innovation ecosystem","Canada; agroindustry; consumption behavior; firm size; innovation; network analysis; social network","Audretsch D.B., Cunningham J.A., Kuratko D.F., Et al., Entrepreneurial Ecosystems: Economic, Technological, and Societal Impacts, Journal of Technology Transfer, 44, pp. 313-325, (2019); BarNir A., Smith K.A., Interfirm Alliances in the Small Business: The Role of Social Networks, Journal of Small Business Management, 40, 3, pp. 219-232, (2002); Bartholomew S., Smith A.D., Improving Survey Response Rates from Chief Executive Officers in Small Firms: The Importance of Social Networks, Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, 30, 1, pp. 83-96, (2006); Blondel V.D., Guillaume J.-L., Lambiotte R., Lefebvre E., Fast Unfolding of Communities in Large Networks, Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment, 2008, (2008); Boschma R., Proximity and Innovation: A Critical Assessment, Regional Studies, 39, 1, pp. 61-74, (2005); Callon M., Courtial J.P., Turner W.A., Bauin S., From Translations to Problematic Networks: An Introduction to co-Word Analysis, Social Science Information, 22, 2, pp. 191-235, (1983); Carayannis E.G., Rozakis S., Grigoroudis E., Agri-science to Agri-Business: The Technology Transfer Dimension, The Journal of Technology Transfer, 43, 4, pp. 837-843, (2018); Ciarli T., Rafols I., The Relation Between Research Priorities and Societal Demands: The Case of Rice, Research Policy, 48, 4, pp. 949-967, (2019); Cui Z., Ouyang T., Chen J., Li C., From Peripheral to Core: A Case Study of a 3D Printing Firm on Business Ecosystems Reconstruction, Technology Analysis & Strategic Management, 31, 12, pp. 1381-1394, (2019); Doloreux D., Regional Networks of Small and Medium Sized Enterprises: Evidence from the Metropolitan Area of Ottawa in Canada, European Planning Studies, 12, 2, pp. 173-189, (2004); Etzkowitz H., Leydesdorff L., The Dynamics of Innovation: From National Systems and “Mode 2” to a Triple Helix of University–Industry–Government Relations, Research Policy, 29, 2, pp. 109-123, (2000); Freeman C., The ‘National System of Innovation’ in Historical Perspective, Cambridge Journal of Economics, 19, 1, pp. 5-24, (1995); Gereffi G., Fernandez-Stark K., Global Value Chain Analysis: a Primer.

Design/methodology/approach: This study used a quantitative method by spreading offline and online surveys toward halal-certified firms in Taiwan. Data were obtained from 41 responses and were analyzed using partial least square structural equation modeling. Findings: This study discovers that firms in Taiwan practice halal business as they possess halal perceived value and innovation orientation. In addition, the interplays of the antecedents, the internal and external drivers, also play an excellent role in shaping the firms’ practices on halal business. Research limitations/implications: Despite the implications, this study was built under several limitations that are potentially addressed by future research. The limitations lay in the low response rate, indistinctive analysis based on the firms’ market orientations (domestic or international) and the exclusion of other relevant variables to the conceptual model. Practical implications: Practically, this study clarifies that firms in a Muslim minority country can be encouraged to engage in halal business in several ways. Those with a good understanding of halal usefulness are oriented to innovation, exposed to external pressures about halal business and equipped with specific internal settings that can translate the halal business phenomenon as an opportunity, not a threat. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first to unveil the drivers of halal business practices of firms in a Muslim minority country. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Halal;

Design/methodology/approach: Using a convenient sample approach, data was obtained from the UAE government agencies. The various constructions were analysed using partial least squares structural equation modelling in SmartPLS. Findings: The results show that innovation orientation has an impact on service innovation. Knowledge sharing also functions as a moderator in the link between innovation orientation and government service innovation. Originality/value: This paper contributes both theoretically and practically. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, it is one of the first studies to examine direct correlations between innovation orientation and government service innovation, giving evidence of the moderating function of knowledge sharing in innovation orientation and service innovation. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Government service innovation; Innovation orientation; Knowledge sharing","Knowledge management; Empirical investigation; Government agencies; Government service innovation; Government services; Information sharing; Innovation orientation; Knowledge-sharing; Orientation information; Service innovation; United Arab Emirates; Least squares approximations","Al Marzouqi S., The organisational capabilities and their effects on service innovation and service innovation process in the UAE public sector, International Journal of Management and Commerce Innovations, 7, 1, pp. 124-140, (2019); Alosani M.S., The Effect of Continuous Improvement Tools on Organizational Performance of the Dubai Police: The Mediating Role of Innovation Culture, (2019); Alosani M.S., Al-Dhaafri H.S., Awadh Abdulla A., Investigating the role of HRM practices on service innovation: empirical evidence from UAE government agencies, Management Research Review, 44, 1, pp. 1-24, (2021); Aydin S., Dube M., Knowledge management, innovation, and competitive advantage: is the relationship in the eye of the beholder?, Knowledge Management Research and Practice, 16, 3, pp. 402-413, (2018); Bloch C., Bugge M.M., Public sector innovation: from theory to measurement, Structural Change and Economic Dynamics, 27, pp. 133-145, (2013); Bock G.W., Zmud R.W., Kim Y.G., Behavioral intention formation in knowledge sharing: examining the roles of extrinsic motivators, social-psychological forces, and organizational climate, MIS Quarterly, 29, 1, pp. 87-111, (2005); Borins S., The Persistence of Innovation in Government, (2014); Innovations in Government: Research, Recognition, and Replication, (2008); Byrne B.M., Structural Equation Modeling with Amos: Basic Concepts, Applications, and Programming, (2010); Chen J., Walker R.M., Sawhney M., Public service innovation: a typology, Public Management Review, 22, 11, pp. 1674-1695, (2020); Chen J.S., Tsou H.T., Ching R.K.H., Co-production and its effects on service innovation, Industrial Marketing Management, 40, 8, pp. 1331-1346, (2011); Cheng Y., The study on the relationship among organizational culture, knowledge sharing and organizational innovation, (2002); Choi S., Learning orientation and market orientation as catalysts for innovation in nonprofit organizations, Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly, 43, 2, pp. 393-413, (2014); Damanpour F., Schneider M., Characteristics of innovation and innovation adoption in public organizations: Assessing the role of managers, Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory, 19, 3, pp. 495-522, (2009); Derlukiewicz N., Mempel-Sniezyk A., Mankowska D., Development of innovation economy-activity of local government in Poland, European Research Studies Journal, 24, Issue 2, pp. 175-195, (2021); Dobni C.B., The relationship between an innovation orientation and competitive strategy, International Journal of Innovation Management, 14, 2, pp. 331-357, (2010); Dwivedi P., Chaturvedi V., Vashist J.K., Transformational leadership and employee efficiency: knowledge sharing as mediator, Benchmarking: An International Journal, 27, 4, pp. 1571-1590, (2020); Farooq R., Vij S., Does market orientation mediate between knowledge management orientation and business performance?, Journal of Information and Knowledge Management, 18, 4, pp. 1-35, (2019); Fornell C., Larcker D.F., Evaluating structural equation models with unobservable variables and measurement error, Journal of Marketing Research, 18, 1, pp. 39-50, (1981); Fu H., The relationships between and influencing factors of knowledge sharing and innovation in online virtual professional knowledge community for corporate organization, (2003); Gao G.Y., Zhou K.Z., Yim C.K., On what should firms focus in transitional economies?

With the focus specifically on Kazakhstan, this paper examines how the leadership of universities in this country views a higher education funding model– the state grants. The paper applies the lenses of stability, performance and innovation orientation to the examination of the state grants-based higher education funding model in Kazakhstan. This paper finds that despite recognition of the limitations of the existing funding model, there is limited interest to push for changes. This can be explained by the complex higher education policy environment which is also discussed in this paper. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Higher education funding; Higher education governance; Higher education management; Higher education policy; Kazakhstan","Kazakhstan; education policy; education reform; educational development; governance approach; higher education; innovation; performance assessment","Ahn E., Dixon J., Chemareva L., Looking at Kazakhstan's higher education landscape: from transition to transformation between 1920 and 2015, 25 Years of Transformations of Higher Education Systems in Post-Soviet Countries: Reform and Continuity, pp. 199-228, (2018); Ait Si Mhamed A., Ibrasheva A., Kasa R., Nurmagambetov A., Sagintayeva A., Vossensteyn H., Development of Strategic Directions for Education Reforms of Kazakhstan for 2015–2020.

After seven years of development, the innovation orientation of mass entrepreneurship and innovation has become an important engine leading China’s economic growth in the future. This research aims to examine the effect of innovation orientation on enterprise innovation performance. Based on a survey of 378 high-tech SMEs in Sichuan Province, China, structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed to examine the research model. The result shows that innovation orientation and organizational flexibility significantly affect enterprise innovation performance. Among the effects of innovation orientation on enterprise innovation performance, capability and resource flexibility play mediators. This research disclosed that important factors affecting the innovation performance of high-tech SMEs enterprises include resource flexibility and capability flexibility. To give better play to the positive impact of innovation orientation, we should strengthen the flexible strategy of organizations. Thus, committed to more flexible market development, promoting the vigorous development of new technologies, new industries, and new formats, and realizing the growth of enterprise innovation performance. © 2022 by the authors.","high-tech; innovation orientation; innovation performance; organizational flexibility; SMEs","China; Davos; Graubunden; Sichuan; Switzerland; Tianjin; economic growth","Turdiyeva M.U., Importance of Innovations in the Development of Bukhara Industry.

Quantitative approach, by using structural modelling equations, to analyze data from 151 innovative agri-food firms was used in this study. Then, using a fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), was carried out to obtain additional insights. The main result find that market orientation plays a key role both in exploitative and exploratory innovation in agribusiness firms. Innovation exploitation is influenced by the firm’s organic structure. Results from fsQCA provide valuable findings showing that innovation exploitation and exploration result from distinct organizational configurations, thus providing valuable insights for decision and policy-making. © 2024, The Author(s).","Innovation; Organic structure; Organizational climate; Organizational culture; Proactive management","","Aboramadan M., Albashiti B., Alharazin H., Zaidoune S., Organizational culture, innovation and performance: a study from a non-western context, J Manag Dev, 39, 4, pp. 437-451, (2020); Acosta-Prado J.C., Relationship between organizational climate and innovation capability in new technology-based firms, J Open Innov Technol Mark Complex, 6, (2020); Aiken M., Hage J., The organic organization and innovation, Sociology, 5, pp. 63-82, (1971); Akman G., Yilmaz C., Innovative capability, innovation strategy and market orientation: an empirical analysis in Turkish software industry, Int J Innov Manag, 12, 1, pp. 69-111, (2008); Bagozzi R.P., Yi Y., On the evaluation of structural equation models, J Acad Mark Sci, 16, 1, pp. 74-94, (1988); Bernal O., Maicas J.P., Vargas P., Exploration, exploitation and innovation performance: disentangling the evolution of industry, Ind Innov, 26, 3, pp. 295-320, (2019); Burns T.E., Stalker G.M., The management of innovation, (1961); Buschgens T., Bausch A., Balkin D., Organizational culture and innovation: a meta-analytic review, J Prod Innov Manag, 30, 4, pp. 1-19, (2013); Cabello-Medina C., Carmona-Lavado A., Cuevas-Rodriguez G., Organisation of R&D departments as determinant of innovation: testing alternative explanations, Technol Anal Strateg Manag, 23, 4, pp. 383-400, (2011); Camanzi L., Arba E., Rota C., Zanasi C., Malorgio G., A structural equation modeling analysis of relational governance and economic performance in agri-food supply chains: evidence from the dairy sheep industry in Sardinia (Italy), Agric Food Econ, 6, (2018); Castillo-Valero J.S., Garcia-Cortijo M.C., Factors that determine innovation in agrifood firms, Agron, 11, (2021); Chen Y.S., Chang C.H., Wu F.S., Origins of green innovations: the differences between proactive and reactive green innovations, Manag Decis, 50, 3, pp. 368-398, (2012); Chen Z., Huang S., Liu C., Min M., Zhou L., Fit between organizational culture and innovation strategy: Implications for innovation performance, Sustainability, 10, 10, (2018); Corchuelo B., Lopez-Salazar P.E., Sama-Berrocal C., Determining factors of innovative performance: case studies in extremaduran agri-food companies, Sustainability, 12, 21, (2020); Corchuelo B., Lopez-Salazar P.E., Sama-Berrocal C., Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on agri-food companies in the region of extremadura (Spain), Agronomy, 11, 5, (2021); Corchuelo B., Sama-Berrocal C., Objectives of and barriers to innovation: how do they influence the decision to innovate?, J Open Innov Technol Mark Complex, 8, (2022); Crant J.M., Proactive behavior in organizations, J Manag, 26, 3, pp. 435-462, (2016); Cumming B.S., Innovation overview and future challenges, Eur J Innov Manag, 1, 1, pp. 21-29, (1998); Damanpour F., Organizational innovation: A meta-analysis of effects of determinants and moderators, Organizational Innovation.

These spaces give students and instructors access to advanced design technology and facilitate the incorporation of a wide variety of projects into the curriculum; however, their impacts on students are not yet fully understood. Using matched survey responses (i.e., repeated measures) from undergraduate students enrolled in engineering courses that assigned a makerspace-based project, we evaluate how the use of a university makerspace impacts students’ attitudes towards design, engineering, and technology. Further, we examine whether there are differences based on students’ year in program, gender, and race. Results: Paired t-tests were used to analyze whether and how nine factors changed within individual students over one semester. Analyses revealed that students who visited the facility showed significant gains in measures of innovation orientation, design self-efficacy, innovation self-efficacy, technology self-efficacy, belonging to the makerspace, and belonging to the engineering community. Subsequently, repeated measures analyses of variance (RMANOVAs) on the students who visited the makerspace revealed significant main effects of students’ year in program, gender, and race, as well as interactional effects of both year in program and race with time. Conclusions: These results affirm the value of incorporating makerspace-based projects into STEM curricula, especially during early coursework. However, our analyses revealed consistent gender gaps in measures of self-efficacy before and after using the makerspace. Similarly, gains in belonging to the makerspace were not equal across racial groups. We conclude that while makerspaces are fulfilling some of their promise for educating innovative problem solvers, more attention needs to be paid to avoid reproducing disparities in STEM education that are already experienced by female students and racial minorities. © 2021, The Author(s).","Innovation; Makerspace; Self-efficacy; Sense of belonging; Survey","","Ali P., Cooke M., Culpepper M.L., Forest C.R., Hartmann B., Kohn M., Wilczynski V., The value of campus collaboration for higher education makerspaces, (2016); Envisioning the future of the maker movement: Summit report, (2016); Advancing the maker movement: Making and makerspaces at engineering and engineering technology schools and departments and outside the engineering academic maker community, (2017); Andrews M.E., Patrick A.D., Borrego M., Engineering students’ attitudinal beliefs by gender and student division: A methodological comparison of changes over time, International Journal of STEM Education, 8, (2021); Banda R.M., Flowers A.M., Birds of a feather do not always flock together: A critical analysis of Latina engineers and their involvement in student organizations, Journal of Hispanic Higher Education, 16, 4, pp. 359-374, (2016); Bandura A., Social Foundations of Thought and Action: A Social Cognitive Theory, (1986); Bandura A., Self-Efficacy: The Exercise of Control, (1997); Barrett T.W., Pizzico M.C., Levy B., Nagel R.L., Linsey J.S., Talley K.G., Newstetter W.C., A review of university maker spaces, 122Nd ASEE Annual Conference &, (2015); Betz N.E., Hackett G., Applications of self-efficacy theory to understanding career choice behavior, Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology, 4, 3, pp. 279-289, (1986); Brainard S.G., Carlin L., A six-year longitudinal study of undergraduate women in engineering and science, Journal of Engineering Education, 87, 4, pp. 369-375, (1998); Brubaker E.R., Kohn M., Sheppard S., Comparing Outcomes of Introductory Makerspace Courses: The Roles of Reflection and Multi-Age Communities of Practice, (2019); Carbonell R.M., Andrews M.E., Boklage A., Borrego M., Innovation, design, and self-efficacy: The impact of makerspaces, 125Th ASEE Annual Conference &, (2019); Cass C.A.P., Hazari Z., Cribbs J., Sadler P.M., Sonnert G., Examining the impact of mathematics identity on the choice of engineering careers for male and female students, (2011); Choe N.H., Martins L.L., Borrego M., Kendall M.R., Professional aspects of engineering: Improving prediction of undergraduates' engineering identity, Journal of Professional Issues in Engineering Education and Practice, 145, 3, (2019); Cohen J., Statistical Power Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences, (2013); Dogan B., Dogan B., Ulku E.E., Bas A., Erdal H., The role of the maker movement in engineering education: Student views on key issues of makerspace environment, International Journal of Engineering Education, 36, 4, pp. 1161-1169, (2020); Dougherty D., The maker movement, Innovations: Technology, Governance, Globalization, 7, 3, pp. 11-14, (2012); Eccles J.S., Wigfield A., Motivational beliefs, values, and goals, Annual Review of Psychology, 53, 1, pp. 109-132, (2002); Forest C.R., Moore R.A., Jariwala A.S., Fasse B.B., Linsey J.S., Newstetter W.C., Et al., The invention studio: A university maker space and culture, Advances in Engineering Education, 4, 2, pp. 1-32, (2014); Foster C.H., Dickens M., Jordan S.S., Lande M., Learning from toy makers in the field to inform teaching engineering de-sign in the classroom, 122Nd ASEE Annual Conference &, (2015); Garriott P.O., Navarro R.L., Flores L.Y., Lee H.S., Carrero Pinedo A., Slivensky D., Et al., Surviving and thriving: Voices of Latina/o engineering students at a Hispanic serving institution, Journal of Counseling Psychology, 66, 4, pp. 437-448, (2019); Godbole A., Miller B., Bothwell M., Davis S., Montfort D., Nolen S., Engineering students’ perceptions of belonging through the lens of social identity, 1St Annual Conference of Conecd Collaborative Network for Engineering and Computing Diversity, (2018); Godwin A., Potvin G., Hazari Z., Lock R., Understanding engineering identity through structural equation modeling, (2013); Good C., Rattan A., Dweck C.S., Why do women opt out?

Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on the theoretical frameworks of the resource-based view and dynamic capability theory, this scholarly inquiry has proposed a comprehensive framework that delineates the relationships amongst imitation, innovation, absorptive capacity (ACAP), innovation performance and financial performance. To scrutinize the proposed research model, bootstrap routines were used through Smart partial least squares to estimate the procedures. To collect the necessary data, a questionnaire and financial statements were acquired from a sample of 100 Iranian firms listed on the Tehran Stock Exchange. The findings of the study have important implications for both scholars and practitioners seeking to enhance firm performance through the effective utilization of imitation, innovation and ACAP. Findings: The results indicate that imitation activities have directly led to the improvement in innovation performance, even in the presence of innovation and ACAP. However, the relationship has not been confirmed by financial performance. Originality/value: Imitation and innovation orientations have been identified as pivotal strategic orientations that can significantly affect firm performance. As far as the authors know, this investigation represents the first comprehensive examination of both imitation and innovation activities as a critical transition in emerging markets (EMs) characterized by complex economies, such as Iran. The findings may aid firms in enhancing their performance by providing insight into the strategic importance of imitation and innovation orientations in EMs. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Absorptive capacity; Financial performance; Imitation; Innovation; Innovation performance","","Adams P., Bodas Freitas I.M., Fontana R., Strategic orientation, innovation performance and the moderating influence of marketing management, Journal of Business Research, 97, pp. 129-140, (2019); Aguirre-Urreta M.I., Hu J., Detecting common method bias, ACM SIGMIS Database: The DATABASE for Advances in Information Systems, 50, 2, pp. 45-70, (2019); Ahuja G., Katila R., Where do resources come from?

It addresses the deliberate avoidance of (over)spending during holidays and states that this behaviour may be just as conspicuous and provide social signals that are just as strong as those connected to the consumption of expensive luxury goods. The conceptual development is based on a combination of the two dichotomies of ‘consumption versus non-consumption’ and ‘conspicuous versus inconspicuous’, resulting in four conceptually distinctive categories of behaviour: conspicuous consumption, conspicuous non-consumption, inconspicuous non-consumption and conspicuous non-consumption. The latter, conspicuous non-consumption, is of special interest in this article, exemplified through personal vignettes. Explorative readings of travel blogs lead to the identification of five themes that characterize conspicuous non-consumption in tourism: ‘identity building’, ‘recycling, upcycling and repurposing’, ‘spiritualizing’, ‘retreating and detoxing’ and ‘slowing down’. Usually, tourism innovation policies are characterized by a ritual growth compulsion, and do not celebrate non-consumption, which is found to be synonymous with non-innovation. This is a paradox for the timely modernizing of tourist services and destinations. Increasingly, there is a need to reorient innovation and to give consideration to how the innovation of ‘nothing’ can also undergo a distinctive progression and even contribute positively to tourism economies. This article highlights the entry points for innovation at the tourism business and destination levels. © The Author(s) 2019.","conceptual model; conspicuousness; innovation; innovation orientation; non-consumption","","Ateljevic I., Doorne S., Culture, Economy and Tourism Commodities: Social Relations of Production and Consumption, Tourist Studies, 3, 2, (2003); Bakker M., Luxury and Tailor-Made Holidays, Travel & Tourism Analyst, 20, pp. 1-47, (2005); Barter C., Renold E., The Use of Vignettes in Qualitative Research, Social Research Update, 25, 9, pp. 1-6, (1999); Besson A., Everyday Aesthetics on Staycation as a Pathway to Restoration, International Journal of Humanities and Cultural Studies, 4, 2, pp. 34-52, (2017); Blichfeldt B.S., Vacationing at Home, Tourism Recreation Research, 33, 1, pp. 93-97, (2008); Bosangit C., McCabe S., Hibbert S., What Is Told in Travel Blogs?

A total of 355 managers drawn from different types of manufacturing firms in the UAE participated in the study, and the collected data were analyzed using PLS-SEM to test the structural model with the aid of Smart PLS 3. The findings from the study revealed that BMI does not directly influence SIO but has an indirect effect through MACS. Moreover, this study revealed that MACS mediate the relationship between BMI and financial performance. In addition, the argument that SIO influences overall corporate performance was supported with our findings. Finally, it was established in this study that MACS and SIO partially mediate the relationship between BMI and environmental performance as well as BMI and employee performance. © 2021 by the authors.

A great deal of research has analyzed the characteristics that make up an innovation-focused OC; however, none have unified them. This article analyzes and integrates the literature on the characteristics of an innovation OC. Its objective was to test whether there is a specific set of distinctive characteristics of an innovation-focused OC that, once identified, can be implemented and developed by firms. To this end, this study proposed and tested a model for measuring the innovation orientation of an OC. This study collected samples from small-and medium-sized companies from the oil-producing states of Mexico, obtaining information from 176 companies. To determine the group of characteristics that make up an organizational culture of innovation (OCI), the authors applied non-experimental, descriptive, transactional research with a quantitative approach. Results were obtained through the application of the following statistical techniques: Bonnet test, KMO index, Bartlett’s sphericity, Chi-square, confirmatory factor analysis, Cronbach’s alpha, principal component analysis and structural equations, which made it possible to measure the level of innovation of the OCI of these companies and to determine the characteristics that comprise it. The proposed model allowed us to identify the existence of a specific group of behavioral characteristics that emanate from a company’s personnel and another group of characteristics that arise from the company itself. Both integrated groups determine whether the OC is focused on innovation. The results also confirmed that the level of innovation of a company depends greatly on its personnel. The authors found no previous work that analyzed these characteristics from the joint perspectives of employees, middle managers and managers. This research considered the opinions of these agents, which confers greater veracity to the findings obtained. The limitations and implications are listed at the end of the study. © 2022 by the authors.

This novel approach, using state-of-the-art machine learning methodologies and multiple recognized drivers of eco-innovation, provides solid empirical support for the understanding of the mechanisms that are crucial for firms' transition to a low-carbon economy. Although many drivers have been considered to affect firms’ eco-innovation, our feature selection process using the BorutaShap algorithm demonstrates that few aspects are truly relevant. Furthermore, analyzing a tree surrogate of the final model, our study explores the different paths or combinations of aspects that consistently lead to a specific eco-innovation orientation. The accuracy of the model and the large and complete spectrum of innovative companies in the sample contribute to the generalizability of the results. This study is particularly relevant because the main drivers of firms’ eco-innovative orientation depend on their innovative behavior, indicating that the managerial and policy work has to be directed to raising awareness of the different externalities derived from innovation. On one side, policy regulations should continue to pressure firms with environmental standards. On the other side, managers can stimulate the creation of a corporate innovative culture oriented toward improving operational efficiency (reducing unnecessary costs), improving the workplace environment, and focusing on new customer demands, which, in essence, will guide the organization to be more environmentally and socially responsible. © 2021 The Authors","Drivers; Eco-innovation; Innovative firms; Machine learning","accuracy assessment; algorithm; empirical analysis; firm size; innovation; machine learning","Kemp R., Pearson P., Final report MEI project about measuring eco-innovation, UM Merit, Maastricht, 10, 2, (2007); Carrillo-Hermosilla J., del Rio P., Konnola T., Diversity of eco-innovations: reflections from selected case studies, J Clean Prod, 18, 10-11, pp. 1073-1083, (2010); EIO (Eco-Innovation Observatory), Europe in transition.

It shows how firms’ strategic focus on innovation and integrated R&D initiatives can help mitigate shareholders’ losses and protect market value during negative macroeconomic shocks. Design/methodology/approach: We analyzed financial and administrative data from firms listed in the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) 500 index and used the Fama French market model with appropriate instruments accounting for possible endogeneity to identify the impact. To ensure the reliability of our findings, we conducted robustness checks with alternate event windows, estimation methods, and variable measurements. Findings: Strategic R&D plays a crucial role in building resilience against macroeconomic shocks. It effectively mitigated shareholders’ losses in the immediate aftermath of the shock, with an elasticity of abnormal returns of 7.65% on day zero, 13.1% during the first five days and 10.5% after the first fortnight. We also find that firms that are business-to-business (B2B), as well as those that are older and less leveraged, are better able to combat such a shock. Research limitations/implications: The study looked at one shock, namely demonetization. Future research is needed to demonstrate the generalizability of results during other macroeconomic shocks, like the COVID-19 pandemic. The study focuses on relatively near-term impacts, leaving the long-term value-creation effects of strategic R&D unexplored. Practical implications: Innovation orientation acts as a structural enabler, allowing firms to make strategic R&D investments that mitigate losses during macroeconomic shocks. It explains that managers should avoid myopically managing R&D investments and align them with the firm’s innovation focus to enhance value creation. Social implications: While the currency demonetization was widely considered to be detrimental for firms as an unannounced negative monetary shock, our research shows that firms with high levels of strategic R&D were successfully able to counteract such a shock. Originality/value: This is the first study to examine the short-term loss mitigation impact of firms’ focus on innovation and strategic R&D. It emphasizes the role of innovation-focused strategies during economic crises. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Abnormal returns; Economic crisis; Event study; Innovation orientation; Strategic marketing investments; Strategic R&D","","Aggarwal K., Malik S., Mishra D.K., Paul D., Moving from cash to cashless economy: toward digital India, The Journal of Asian Finance, Economics and Business, 8, 4, pp. 43-54, (2021); Appiah-Adu K., Singh S., Customer orientation and performance: a study of SMEs, Management Decision, 36, 6, pp. 385-394, (1998); Atuahene-Gima K., Ko A., An empirical investigation of the effect of market orientation and entrepreneurship orientation alignment on product innovation, Organization Science, 12, 1, pp. 54-74, (2001); Baker W.E., Sinkula J.M., The synergistic effect of market orientation and learning orientation on organizational performance, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 27, 4, pp. 411-427, (1999); Berthon P., Hulbert J.M., Pitt L.F., To serve or create?

However, not all entrepreneurship is inherently innovative, raising the question of whether cultural diversity may increase the likelihood of an entrepreneur pursuing an innovative instead of a more replicative business strategy. This study investigates the relationship between regional cultural diversity and the innovation orientation of early-stage entrepreneurs and considers moderating factors by decomposing shares of foreign-born population by origin (within and outside of the EU) and by education level. Combining survey data from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor with population-based indicators of cultural diversity, we carry out a multilevel analysis for 140 European regions. The results suggest that entrepreneurs in culturally more diverse regions are significantly more likely to exhibit innovation orientation. © The Author(s) 2024.","Cultural diversity; Entrepreneurship; European regions; F22; Innovation; L26; Multilevel analysis; O30; R1","","Akerlof G.A., The market for “lemons”: Quality uncertainty and the market mechanism, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 84, 3, pp. 488-500, (1970); Alesina A., Harnoss J., Rapoport H., Birthplace diversity and economic prosperity, Journal of Economic Growth, 21, (2016); Alesina A., La Ferrara E., Ethnic diversity and economic performance, Journal of Economic Literature, 43, 3, pp. 762-800, (2005); Alvarez S.A., Barney J.B., Discovery and creation: Alternative theories of entrepreneurial action, Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal, 1, 1-2, pp. 11-26, (2007); Arrow K.J., Limited knowledge and economic analysis, American Economic Review, 64, 1, pp. 1-10, (1974); Artuc E., Docquier F., Ozden C., Parsons C., A global assessment of human capital mobility: The role of Non-OECD destinations, World Development, 65, pp. 6-26, (2015); Audretsch D.B., Belitski M., The missing pillar: The creativity theory of knowledge spillover entrepreneurship, Small Business Economics, 41, 4, pp. 819-836, (2013); Audretsch D.B., Belitski M., Frank Knight, uncertainty and knowledge spillover entrepreneurship, Journal of Institutional Economics, 17, 6, pp. 1005-1031, (2021); Audretsch D., Belitski M., Korosteleva J., Cultural diversity and knowledge in explaining entrepreneurship in European cities, Small Business Economics, 56, 2, pp. 593-611, (2021); Audretsch D., Dohse D., Niebuhr A., Cultural diversity and entrepreneurship: A regional analysis for Germany, Annals of Regional Science, 45, 1, pp. 55-85, (2010); Awaworyi Churchill S., Fractionalization, entrepreneurship, and the institutional environment for entrepreneurship, Small Business Economics, 48, 3, pp. 577-597, (2017); Bakker R.M., McMullen J.S., Inclusive entrepreneurship: A call for a shared theoretical conversation about unconventional entrepreneurs, Journal of Business Venturing, 38, 1, (2023); Baumol W.J., The microtheory of innovative entrepreneurship, (2010); Ben Letaifa S., Rabeau Y., Too close to collaborate?

Design/methodology/approach: Data for the study is collected from 311 start-up firms in Turkey and is analysed via Structural Equation Modelling. Findings: The results indicate that the effects of human capital and social capital on dynamic innovation capability are fully mediated by innovation orientation (IO). Besides, dynamic innovation capability is found to be strongly associated with innovation performance. Practical implications: In the study, IO is suggested as a useful mechanism for encouraging the deployment of an innovation focus in all functions of a firm for attaining long-term sustained competitiveness. Thereby, the findings are expected to present important implications for start-up founders and policy-makers, by highlighting the importance of knowledge management and investing in human and social capital resources for generating the capability to innovate. Originality/value: The most significant contribution of the study is the development of a model suggesting IO as a mediating variable between the IC resources and dynamic innovation capability relationship in the context of start-up firms. Furthermore, the findings indicate a positive and significant association between the dynamic innovation capability and innovation performance in these economic units. © World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.","Dynamic innovation capability; innovation orientation; intellectual capital; start-ups","","Abbas J, Zhang Q, Hussain I, Akram S, Afaq A, Shad MA, Sustainable innovation in small medium enterprises: the impact of knowledge management on organizational innovation through a mediation analysis by using SEM approach, Sustainability, 12, 6, (2020); Amabile TM, Conti R, Environmental determinants of work motivation, creativity, and innovation: The case of R&D downsizing, Technological innovation: Oversights and foresights, pp. 111-125, (1997); Amar AD, Juneja JA, A descriptive model of innovation and creativity in organizations: A synthesis of research and practice, Knowledge Management Research & Practice, 6, 4, pp. 298-311, (2008); Arvanitis S, Stucki T, What determines the innovation capability of firm founders?, Industrial and Corporate Change, 21, pp. 1049-1084, (2012); Asija A, Ringov D, Dynamic capabilities: The role of board monitoring and managerial incentives, BRQ Business Research Quarterly, 24, 4, pp. 268-280, (2021); Autio E, George G, Alexy O, International entrepreneurship and capability development: Qualitative evidence and future research directions, Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, 35, 1, pp. 11-37, (2011); Autry CW, Griffis SE, Supply chain capital: The impact of structural and relational linkages on firm execution and innovation, Journal of Business Logistics, 29, pp. 157-173, (2008); Barney JB, Hansen MH, Trustworthiness as a source of competitive advantage, Strategic Management Journal, 15, S1, pp. 175-190, (1994); Baron RM, Kenny DA, The moderator-mediator variable distinction in social psychological research: Conceptual, strategic and statistical considerations, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51, pp. 1173-1182, (1986); Becheikh N, Landry R, Amara N, Lessons from innovation empirical studies in the manufacturing sector: A systematic review of the literature from 1993–2003, Technovation, 26, 5–6, pp. 644-664, (2006); Berends H, Jelinek M, Reymen I, Stultiens R, Product innovation processes in small firms: Combining entrepreneurial effectuation and managerial causation, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 31, 3, pp. 616-635, (2014); Berthon P, Hulbert JM, Pitt LF, To serve or create?

To achieve this objective, the actors’ perspective from the reframed Innovation Helix is applied. The main result is that the Banking and monetary authorities are rather centred on short-term system stability, which at the longer term can be counterproductive in terms of sustainability. Industry is mainly centred on competitiveness however increasingly taking into account the ‘green transition’. The society, academia and natural environment visions are strongly focused on sustainability. Currency innovations are envisaged at all the levels, bringing different proposals which can be complementary and that bring the potential of more bottom-up initiatives, collaboration and sustainability in socioecological dimension. Metamodern prospect enriches the standpoint, especially in societal and individual aspect of ‘daring to know’ which this document tries to boost. © 2020, Universidad de Guadalajara.

Yet, despite this growing body of open innovation research, there are still gaps and limitations. Notably, most prior studies have been conducted in Europe, limiting their generalizability to the rest of the world, and are replicative, exploring performance and competitive outcomes. There is very limited work examining the potential limitations of open innovation. This study extends innovation orientation research and examines the limitations of open innovation in North America. Design/methodology/approach: This study explores the relationships between innovation orientation and performance, open innovation and performance and innovation orientation and open innovation among 386 North American companies. Findings: This study is novel as it examines the relationships between innovation orientation and performance, open innovation and performance and innovation orientation and open innovation among North American companies. The research uncovers a linear relationship between innovation orientation and performance, a correlation between innovation orientation and open innovation and a counterintuitive curvilinear relationship between open innovation and performance. The curvilinear relationship, shaped as an inverted u-shape, suggests there are limitations to the strategy's effectiveness, actionable insight to companies, consultants and scholars alike. In the discussion section, findings are further unpacked with regard to their implications for the scholarly literature. The paper concludes with managerial considerations for creating an innovation orientation and the most effective level of open innovation for maximum competitive and performance implications. Originality/value: Beyond the innovation orientation and open innovation research contributions, this study offers managerial insight for executives seeking to enhance competitiveness and drive firm performance. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Firm performance; Innovation culture; Innovation orientation; North America; Open innovation","","Abhari K., McGuckin S., Limiting factors of open innovation organizations: a case of social product development and research agenda, Technovation, 119, (2023); Adams K., Attah-Boakye R., Yu H., Johansson J., Njoya E.T., Female board representation and coupled open innovation: evidence from emerging market multinational enterprises, Technovation, 124, (2023); Akgun A.E., Keskin H., Byrne J.C., Aren S., Emotional and learning capability and their impact on product innovativeness and firm performance, Technovation, 27, 9, pp. 501-513, (2007); Andries P., Faems D., Patenting activities and firm performance: does firm size matter?, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 30, 6, pp. 1089-1098, (2013); Asakawa K., Nakamura H., Sawada N., Firms' open innovation policies, laboratories' external collaborations, and laboratories' R&D performance, R&D Management, 40, 2, pp. 109-123, (2010); Audretsch B.D., Belitski M., The limits to open innovation and its impact on innovation performance, Technovation, 119, (2023); Bagherzadeh M., Markovic S., Bogers M., Managing open innovation: a project-level perspective, IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, 68, 1, pp. 301-316, (2019); Barney J., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage, Journal of Management, 17, 1, pp. 99-120, (1991); Bergkvist L., Rossiter J.R., The predictive validity of multiple-item versus single-item measures of the same constructs, Journal of Marketing Research, 44, 2, pp. 175-184, (2007); Bhattacharya L., Burnker V., Why Global Companies Need to Become Fractal Innovators, (2023); Bhuian S.N., Menguc B., Bell S.J., Just entrepreneurial enough: the moderating effect of entrepreneurship on the relationship between market orientation and performance, Journal of Business Research, 58, 1, pp. 9-17, (2005); Bigliardi B., Ferraro G., Filippelli S., Galati F., The past, present and future of open innovation, European Journal of Innovation Management, 24, 4, pp. 1130-1161, (2021); Birley S., Westhead P., Growth and performance contrasts between ‘types’ of small firms, Strategic Management Journal, 11, 7, pp. 535-557, (1990); Bogers M., Chesbrough H., Heaton S., Teece D.J., Strategic management of open innovation: a dynamic capabilities perspective, California Management Review, 62, 1, pp. 77-94, (2019); Brink T., The impact on growth of outside-in and inside-out innovation in SME network contexts, International Journal of Innovation Management, 18, 4, pp. 1-25, (2014); Broderick J.E., Wilson G.A., Female perspective of implementing a failure learning orientation, Journal of Innovation Management, 8, 3, pp. 109-123, (2020); Brunswicker S., Chesbrough H., The Adoption of Open Innovation in Large Firms: practices, Measures, and Risks A survey of large firms examines how firms approach open innovation strategically and manage knowledge flows at the project level, Research-Technology Management, 61, 1, pp. 35-45, (2018); Burwood-Taylor L., Why a global consulting firm acquired an open innovation hub for Agtech in Brazil - AFN, (2023); Cassiman B., Valentini G., Open innovation: are inbound and outbound knowledge flows really complementary?, Strategic Management Journal, 37, 6, pp. 1034-1046, (2016); Cheng C.C., Huizingh E.K., When is open innovation beneficial?

Companies and governments have traditionally tried to promote in-house innovation by promoting research and development investment. In an economy characterized by a large percentage of small- and medium-sized enterprises and continuous change toward digital and green transition, many companies struggle to innovate because of their lack of resources, knowledge, or capabilities. In this context, the external links and networks that materialize through active engagement in innovation activities with market and institutional agents are key, and analyzing cooperation for innovation is essential to obtain an overview to promote innovation. This study contributes to the understanding of (1) the drivers in innovative companies that lead to cooperation with external agents for innovation; (2) the relative importance of these drivers for cooperation; (3) the extent to which the eco-innovation orientation of a company affects its engagement in collaborations with other stakeholders; and (4) an understanding of the differences in the cooperation drivers according to the type of collaborator (institutional, market, or both). Using data from the Spanish Technological Innovation Panel and machine-learning techniques, we confirm the importance of internal and external factors, namely public financing, the environmental and social orientation of innovation, and the commitment to innovation. This research also reveals the asymmetric impact of many of the cooperation drivers, and that company cooperation with both market and institutional agents leads to higher innovation performance. The findings have important implications for policymakers and practitioners. © 2024 The Authors.

Especially with the covid-19 epidemic, it is thought that businesses should be agile and attach importance to sustainable quality in order to adapt to changing conditions, while unforeseen change and transformation processes are experienced today. It can be stated that there is a necessity to always follow the innovations and apply them on time in order to maintain the quality. The research was conducted with a sample of 438 white-collar employees from different sectors in Türkiye. According to the findings obtained; a statistically significant positive correlation was found between OA and SQP, OA and IO, and IO and SQP. In addition, according to the mediation test, it was determined that innovation orientation had a partial and strong mediating role between OA and SQP. © 2022, International Journal of Business.

Design/methodology/approach: The researchers developed a conceptual framework based on vigorous literature for this investigation. This study targeted managers from Pakistan's SME sector as respondents and employed cross-sectional data. In total, the authors based this study's findings on 192 valid cases. Findings: The structural equation modeling (SEM) results highlight that innovation orientation (IO), customer orientation (CO), supplier orientation (SO), network orientation (NO) and absorptive capacity (AC) have significant effects on economic sustainability (ES). Moreover, this study's findings show that ES significantly predicts environmental sustainability (ENS). Finally, the results also demonstrate that ES and ENS positively and substantially affect financial performance (FP). Practical implications: This study's findings help SMEs continue sustainable business practices by avoiding adverse environmental effects and ongoing climate changes. This study's findings contribute also to the manufacture of eco-friendly environmental products to reduce the contamination of the environment. Financial institutions and policymakers would boost SME owners' capacity and the obtainability of financial resources to improve Pakistani SMEs’ sustainable economic and environmental performance. Originality/value: This study's findings help to enrich environmental and economic sustainability and, more significantly, for developing countries. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Absorptive capacity; Economic sustainability; Environmental sustainability; Financial performance; Orientation; SMEs","","Aboelmaged M., Hashem G., Absorptive capacity and green innovation adoption in SMEs: the mediating effects of sustainable organisational capabilities, Journal of Cleaner Production, 220, 2019, pp. 853-863, (2019); Abourokbah S.H., Mashat R.M., Salam M.A., Role of absorptive capacity, digital capability, agility, and resilience in supply chain innovation performance, Sustainability, 15, 4, pp. 1-25, (2023); Acar M.F., Zaim S., Isik M., Calisir F., Relationships among ERP, supply chain orientation and operational performance: an analysis of structural equation modeling, Benchmarking: An International Journal, 24, 5, pp. 1291-1308, (2017); Acosta-Prado J.C., Sanchez G.J.A., Lopez-Montoya O.H., Tafur-Mendoza A.A., Sustainable value creation and organizational performance in industrial manufacturing companies, Measuring Business Excellence, 27, 1, pp. 143-156, (2023); Afum E., Issau K., Agyabeng-Mensah Y., Baah C., Dacosta E., Essandoh E., Boateng A.E., The missing links of sustainable supply chain management and green radical product innovation between sustainable entrepreneurship orientation and sustainability performance, Journal of Engineering, Design and Technology, 21, 1, pp. 167-187, (2023); Agenor P., Canuto O., Jelenic M., Avoiding middle income growth traps, (2012); Aggarwal P., Impact of sustainability performance of company on its financial performance: a study of listed Indian companies, Global Journal of Management and Business Research Finance, 13, 11, pp. 61-70, (2013); Agostini L., Nosella A., Soranzo B., Measuring the impact of relational capital on customer performance in the SME B2B sector: the moderating role of absorptive capacity, Business Process Management Journal, 23, 6, pp. 1144-1166, (2017); Agramunt L.F., Berbel-Pineda J.M., Capobianco-Uriarte M.M., Casado-Belmonte M.P., Review on the relationship of absorptive capacity with inter-organizational networks and the internationalization process, Complexity, pp. 1-20, (2020); Aguinis H., Ramani R.S., Alabduljader N., What you see is what you get?

Innovation is the tool which always keeps the product of any company in demand. As for remaining in existence one needs to manufacture innovative products and ideas. It is the only factor that develops the economy whereas market-orientation is the management of the market by encouraging and enabling the capacity of the organisation. When these two factors Innovation and orientation are combined it puts a positive impact on the economy as through market orientation one can easily make the innovation. This study will examine the link between innovation and orientation in the market of insurance. The data that had been gathered with a view of providing a more clear view of an event based on the connections of variables designed upon a conditioned model which is dependent upon relevant concepts.

Despite the importance of this technology in people’s financial transactions in improving the management of their financial operations, processes, and lives, there is a lack of empirical evidence about sustainable FinTech services in the Jordanian context. Consequently, this research examines the factors that influence the acceptance of FinTech services, which have a variety of social, environmental, and ecological benefits. This study proposes an integrated model by combining the extended technology acceptance model (TAM) with the perceived enjoyment as an independent variable and electronic word of mouth (eWOM) as a moderator variable simultaneously. A total of 304 responses from Jordanian citizens were analyzed by the quantitative method of partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). The result confirmed that perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment have a significant and positive influence on users’ decision to use FinTech services. Meanwhile, eWOM is found to moderate the relationship between perceived usefulness and Jordanians’ decisions to use FinTech services. Finally, this study provides practical implications for managers to encourage them to provide adequate, reliable, and sustainable services to their customers at a reasonable cost that fit their demands and ultimately improve their living standards.

Design/methodology/approach: Resource orchestration and contingency theories are used to address the mediating and moderating effects. A cross-sectional data set on 242 Swedish manufacturers is used to test for the hypotheses using structural equation modeling. Findings: The findings provide support for the mediating roles of manufacturing flexibility and mass customization in the relationship between supply integration and firm performance. However, the results point to contrasting contingent effects of innovation orientation. While innovation orientation positively moderates the association between mass customization and firm performance, it shows a negative impact on the link between flexibility and performance. Research limitations/implications: The study contributes to the literature on the integrative activities with upstream supply chain actors. Specifically, the authors highlight how specific capability configurations comprising of supply integration, manufacturing flexibility and mass customization lead to firm performance. Moreover, the authors provide insights on the contingency role of innovation, especially if firms consider flexibility or customization capabilities. Originality/value: While the individual impacts of flexibility and customization on performance have been addressed previously, there is a paucity of research on how these two capabilities are integrated with supply integration. Moreover, there is little known regarding the role of innovation orientation on these integrated relationships. © 2022, Hamid Jafari, Hadi Ghaderi, Mohammad H.

A hierarchical regression analysis was conducted using 552 entrepreneurial enterprises in mainland China. Our findings indicate that TMT innovation orientation positively mediates the relationship between organisational learning and innovation performance. Likewise, we found that institutional support positively moderates the relationship between organisational learning and TMT innovation orientation. The implications draw TMTs’ attention to consider enriching their innovation orientation by leveraging institutional support for their organisational learning and explorative and exploitative innovation performance. Lastly, government-tailored policies are essential to augment TMT innovation orientation to benefit their organisational learning and innovation performance. © 2022 SAGE Publications.","innovation performance; institutional support; Organisational learning; TMT innovation orientation","innovation; learning; performance assessment; regression analysis","Ademilua V.A., Lasisi T.T., Ogunmokun O.A., Ikhide J.E., Accounting for the effects of entrepreneurial orientation on SMEs’ job creation capabilities: A social capital and self-determination perspective, Journal of Public Affairs, 22, 2, (2020); Ahern T., Leavy B., Byrne P.J., Knowledge formation and learning in the management of projects: A problem solving perspective, International Journal of Project Management, 32, 8, pp. 1423-1431, (2014); Aiken L., West S., Multiple regression: Testing and interpreting interactions, (1991); Ali S., Peters L.D., Khan I.U., Ali W., Saif N., Organizational learning and hotel performance: The role of capabilities’ hierarchy, International Journal of Hospitality Management, 85, (2020); Anderson N., Potocnik K., Zhou J., Innovation and creativity in organizations: A state-of-the science review, prospective commentary, and guiding framework, Journal of Management, 40, 5, pp. 1297-1333, (2014); Argyris C., Schon D., Organizational learning: A theory of action perspective, (1978); Bao Y., Chen X., Zhou K.Z., External learning, market dynamics, and radical innovation: Evidence from China’s high-tech firms, Journal of Business Research, 65, 8, pp. 1226-1233, (2012); Barboza D., China passes Japan as second-largest economy, New York Times, (2010); Bartsch V., Ebers M., Maurer I., Learning in project-based organizations: The role of project teams’ social capital for overcoming barriers to learning, International Journal of Project Management, 31, 2, pp. 239-251, (2013); Bell G.G., Clusters, networks, and firm innovativeness, Strategic Management Journal, 26, 3, pp. 287-295, (2005); Berchicci L., Towards an open R&D system: Internal R&D investment, external knowledge acquisition and innovative performance, Research Policy, 42, 1, pp. 117-127, (2013); Berry S.H., Estimation of correlated response variance without randomization of interviewer assignments, (1980); Bromiley P., Rau D., Social, behavioral, and cognitive influences on upper echelons during strategy process: A literature review, Journal of Management, 42, 1, pp. 174-202, (2016); Bruton G.D., Ahlstrom D., Li H.-L., Institutional theory and entrepreneurship: Where are we now and where do we need to move in the future?, Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, 34, 3, pp. 421-440, (2010); Cabrilo S., Grubic-Nesic L., The role of creativity, innovation and invention in knowledge management, Knowledge management innovations for interdisciplinary education: Organizational applications, pp. 207-233, (2013); Cabrilo S., Dahms D., The role of multidimensional intellectual capital and organizational learning practices in innovation performance, European Management Review, 17, 4, pp. 835-855, (2020); Campanella F., Peruta M.R.D., Guidice M.D., Creating conditions for innovative performance of science parks in Europe.

This study aimed to examine the effect of innovation on the performance of micro and small manufacturing firms in selected towns of Awi Zone, Amhara, Ethiopia. The target population of the study was 643 micro and small manufacturing firms in Injibara, Dangila, and Tilili; a number provided by Awi zone enterprise development office data during 2021. Data were drawn from a sample of 247 manufacturing firms using cross-sectional primary data collected from wood and metal manufacturing firms in selected towns of Awi Zone. The study adopted descriptive and explanatory designs and used correlation and multiple linear regression analysis to estimate the effect of innovation on firm performance. The regression results revealed that product, process, marketing and organizational innovation were positively and significantly related to firm performance, while product innovation was found to have a strong positive effect on the dependent variable firm performance followed by process and organizational innovation, respectively. However, a weak statistical relationship was reported between marketing innovation and the performance of manufacturing firms than other variables. Hence, firms which have a strong orientation towards product, process, organizational and marketing innovation have better performance in manufacturing firms in the study area. © 2023, The Author(s).","Awi Zone;

Our study contributes to the literature by examining how SC flexibility, as a multi-dimensional construct, affects customer responsiveness and if this relationship is moderated by the innovation orientation of a firm. Using data from 225 Swedish manufacturers, we test our proposed empirical model and find empirical support for the positive effects of the supply chain flexibility dimensions on customer responsiveness. In addition, we found support for the strengthening effect of innovation orientation on the link between internal flexibility and customer responsiveness. The empirical validation of the relationship between the multi-dimensional SC flexibility and customer responsiveness which is moderated by the innovation orientation is an original contribution to both theory and practice. © 2022 The Author(s).

The study was carried out on the basis of primary data, where part of the quantitative research were 15 categorized dairies, with low capacity (300-3,000 liters per day), with medium capacity (5,000-100,000 liters per day), and with high capacity (over 100,000 liters per day). From these dairies, 150 workers in leadership positions were surveyed, from which the marketing strategy with the greatest impact on creating competitive advantages was identified. Questionnaires were physically distributed and data were processed through Statistical Package for Social Sciences, version 26. Based on the multiple regression analysis, it was found that there is a statistically significant correlation that marketing strategies affect the creation of competitive advantage based on the value of R-square = 0.787, where customized products strategy, price strategy, and distribution strategy were found as important strategies. While innovation strategy and promotion strategy left the model due to the increased value of significance p > 0.05. Through this study, the dairy industry receives feedback on the type of strategy that should be used to create a competitive advantage, more so in the specific case where imports are very high and competition is very fierce. © Fellanze Pula, Arberesha Qerimi, Fidan Qerimi, 2022.","dairy industry; distribution; innovation; Kosovo; price; product; promotion","","Agzamov A.

Besides, this study also inspected the indirect impact of employee innovation orientation (EIO) on the relationship between LS, ERB, LS and EP. The survey was distributed among employees, asking them to report their perceptions of the given constructs. Using a purposive sample of 262 employees, the data examination was done through the structural model technique. The study’s findings confirmed that leadership strategies play a significant and positive role in EP and extra-role behavior. The moderating impact of EIO on the association between LS and ERB is significant. The paper’s findings provide theoretical implications by adding to the knowledge of the association between the variables under study in the workplace and biotech firms in particular. Furthermore, managers should acknowledge the benefits of effective leadership strategies that positively influence extra-role behavior and employee performance and focus on nurturing employee innovation orientation to impact extra-role behavior. Future research suggestions and limitations of the study are considered. © 2023 ThinkBiotech LLC.

This research topic is important because it can provide a better understanding of the relationship between innovation orientation and performance, since most of the previous papers that have analyzed this relationship have done so from a short-term perspective. But the effect of innovation orientation on performance may not be immediate and short-term, but long-term, and may be influenced by the company’s ability to develop marketing capabilities. A sample of 77 independent hotels is taken for empirical contrast and a system of structural equations is modelled using the Partial Least Squares (PLS) technique. The results show that the company’s capacity to understand the market in which it operates functions as a mechanism that intervenes in the relationship between innovation orientation and long-term result, with a mediating effect that explains the positive effect of innovation orientation on the long-term results. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.","Hotel industry;

Yet its impact on employee behavior and organizational performance is unknown. Addressing this gap, we examine the effect of perceived integrity in leadership on both subjective firm performance and objective employee productivity. Applying dynamic capabilities theory, we propose that perceived integrity in leadership may not only directly affect the outcome variables but also moderate the effect of the firm’s multiple-strategy implementation on outcome variables. We test the hypotheses using multiple informants from a transitional economy with an ineffective legal and incomplete institutional environment, which could seriously challenge the leader’s commitment to integrity. As hypothesized, perceived integrity is associated with manager’s perception of firm performance directly and objective employee productivity through its moderating role in the firm’s implementation process of dual strategies. The results illustrate that perceived integrity in leadership plays as an important driver for employee productivity in dual-strategy and non-strategy firms.

Drawing on the knowledge-spillover literature and resource-dependence theory, this study investigates the effects of new product development (NPD) alliances on building cross-functional capabilities, testing the influences of important organisational, strategic, and environmental contingencies. Based on survey data collected from 212 Chinese firms, the findings reveal that, for resource-abundant firms, R&D-focused NPD alliances have cross-functional fertilisation effects on marketing capabilities; whereas for resource-constrained or highly innovative firms such alliances cannibalise marketing capabilities; in dynamic markets, marketing-focused NPD alliances cross-fertilise technological capabilities, but such an effect is weaker in firms adopting a highly incremental innovation orientation. Overall, this study sheds new light on how NPD alliances affect cross-functional capabilities under important contingencies. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","innovation orientation;

The purpose of this paper is to answer this question, a strategic typology that integrates branding and innovation (BI) from an organizational ambidexterity perspective is proposed. Design/methodology/approach: This paper builds theory by proposing a typology. Integrating the literature on BI, organizational ambidexterity and resource/knowledge-based view of firms, this study posits that to create a value proposition, a firm could choose to engage in innovation and branding activities in a variety of ways depending on their dominant strategic orientation along two dimensions of ambidexterity. Findings: The four proposed typical branding-innovation orientations are low innovation × low branding; low innovation × high branding; high innovation × low branding; and high innovation × high branding. Practical implications: A firm should choose its dominant strategic orientation depending on conditions such as market, consumers, needs and demand and resources. Originality/value: By framing the innovation-branding paradox within an organizational ambidexterity framework, the proposed typology helps integrate two complementary and yet conflicting organizational functions by shifting the focus from an operational to a strategic level. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Ambidexterity; Branding; Co-creation; Exploitation; Exploration; Innovation; Typology","","Aaker D.A., Measuring brand equity across products and markets, California Management Review, 38, 3, pp. 102-120, (1996); Aaker D.A., Innovation: brand it or lose it, California Management Review, 50, 1, pp. 8-24, (2007); Ambler T., Styles C., Brand development versus new product development: toward a process model of extension decisions, Journal of Product & Brand Management, 6, 4, pp. 222-234, (1997); Amit R., Zott C., Value creation in e‐business, Strategic Management Journal, 22, 6-7, pp. 493-520, (2001); Atuahene-Gima K., Resolving the capability-rigidity paradox in new product innovation, Journal of Marketing, 69, 4, pp. 61-83, (2005); Auh S., Shih E., Brand name and consumer inference making in multigenerational product introduction context, Journal of Brand Management, 16, 7, pp. 439-454, (2009); Barney J.B., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage, Journal of Management, 17, 1, pp. 99-120, (1991); Barney J.B., Looking inside for competitive advantage, Academy of Management Perspectives, 9, 4, pp. 49-61, (1995); Most innovative companies of 2019, (2019); Benner M.J., Tushman M.L., Exploitation, exploration, and process management: the productivity dilemma revisited, Academy of Management Review, 28, 2, pp. 238-256, (2003); Beverland M., Brand management and the challenge of authenticity, Journal of Product & Brand Management, 14, 7, pp. 460-461, (2005); Beverland M.B., Napoli J., Farrelly F., Can all brands innovate in the same way?

This study aims to explore how data analytics capability affects servitization by examining the mediation effect of bricolage and the conditional role of innovation orientation. Design/methodology/approach: This study employs the moderated mediation method to examine the proposed research model with archival data and multiple-respondent surveys from 1,206 top managers of 402 manufacturing firms in the Yangtze River Delta area in China. Findings: Bricolage partially mediates the positive relationship between data analytics capability and servitization, and innovation orientation positively moderates this effect. Practical implications: Manufacturers can leverage bricolage to materialize data analytics capability for servitization. Manufacturers should also pursue an innovation orientation to fully glean the benefits of bricolage in transforming data analytics capability into servitization. Originality/value: This study opens the black box of how data analytics capability affects servitization by revealing the underlying mechanism of bricolage and the boundary condition role of innovation orientation for this mechanism. It offers valuable insights for practitioners to leverage data analytics to improve servitization through developing bricolage and cultivating a culture of innovation orientation. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bricolage;

A conceptual model is constructed based on a literature review. The empirical study is based on a survey conducted in a public agency. The empirical analysis of the conceptual model shows that the constructs for purchasing category development and purchasing support and procurement policies exert a statistically significant effect on the innovation orientation in public procurement. Our analysis also indicates that the construct for innovation orientation in public procurement has a statistically significant effect on the purchasing performance. The results suggest that by improving purchasing category development and purchasing support and procurement policies constructs, organisations may improve their innovation orientation in purchasing.

The purpose of this paper is to explore the impact of equity sensitivity on employee mental health. Innovation is considered to be among the critical drivers for the success and future of organizational existence, therefore this paper also investigates how the equity sensitivity impacts innovation orientation and turnover intentions across two geographies India and Hungary. Design/methodology/approach: An online survey was carried out among Hungarian and Indian students. Students were selected only on the basis of having two to three years of work experience and also from good business and economics colleges from India and Hungary. Findings: The results were analyzed using partial least square–structural equation modelling method to test the hypotheses and it showed that equity sensitivity has a positive effect on employee mental health. The findings of the study highlight that even with significant cultural differences equity sensitivity perception does not differ between Hungary and India. Research limitations/implications: The relationship between equity sensitivity and employee mental health is an important area to understand in a volatile economy. Innovation orientation and turnover intention both are important to understand the productivity of any organization; this paper is an effort to understand the impact of both variables bringing in the positive or negative impact on the growth of an organization. Limitations of this study include the sample size, cross-sectional data. Future studies can be based on a larger sample size from wider cross-sections and cultures. Practical implications: Managers need to give importance to understand the equity sensitivity of employee and how it impacts their mental health and well-being. Knowing the volatile nature of economy this becomes very relevant and important for managers and organizations. Social implications: This study is important to understand that how two countries that are significantly different in cultural values still have no difference in equity sensitivity perception. Therefore, equity sensitivity is an important determinant to bring innovation and productivity in organizations across cultures. Originality/value: These findings contribute to literature of equity sensitivity by exploring the impact of equity sensitivity on employee mental health in the context of two countries. Mental health is a concern not only in India but also in Hungarian context as well. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Equity sensitivity; Hungary; India; Innovation orientation; Mental health; Turnover intention","","Adams J.S., Toward an understanding of inequity, The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 67, 5, pp. 422-436, (1963);

Design/methodology/approach: Questionnaires completed by business service companies were analyzed using multiple regression analysis (path analysis), including the mediating variable (KM) and moderating variable (TR). The construct was validated with positive outcomes. Findings: Of the eight hypotheses, six were supported. The study results show that strategic, technological, organizational culture and market dimensions of IO positively influence KM. On the other hand, KM plays an important role as a mediator in supporting the relationship between the four dimensions of IO and performance. Moreover, TR, as a moderator, positively affects the relationship between KM and OP. Originality/value: The study is the first to explore the relationship between six dimensions of IO and KM in business service sector. Furthermore, this study provides evidence that TR can be beneficial for companies with respect to effective KM, which leads to the better performance. © 2023, Krzysztof Borodako, Jadwiga Berbeka, Michał Rudnicki and Mariusz Łapczyński.","Business services; Innovation orientation; Knowledge management; Organizational culture; Organizational performance; Technological readiness","","Aboramadan M., Albashiti B., Alharazin H., Zaidoune S., Organizational culture, innovation and performance: a study from a non-western context, Journal of Management Development, 39, 4, pp. 437-451, (2020); Adams P., Freitas I.M.B., Fontana R., Strategic orientation, innovation performance and the moderating influence of marketing management, Journal of Business Research, 97, pp. 129-140, (2019); Al-Aama A.Y., Technology knowledge management (TKM) taxonomy: using technology to manage knowledge in a Saudi municipality, VINE, 44, 1, pp. 2-21, (2014); Anning-Dorson T., Innovation and competitive advantage creation: the role of organisational leadership in service firms from emerging markets, International Marketing Review, 35, 4, pp. 580-600, (2018); Archibugi D., Filippetti A., The retreat of public research and its adverse consequences on innovation, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 127, pp. 97-111, (2018); Arias-Perez J., Velez-Ocampo J., Cepeda-Cardona J., Strategic orientation toward digitalization to improve innovation capability: why knowledge acquisition and exploitation through external embeddedness matter, Journal of Knowledge Management, 25, 5, pp. 1319-1335, (2021); Avci U., Madanoglu M., Okumus F., Strategic orientation and performance of tourism firms: evidence from a developing country, Tourism Management, 32, 1, pp. 147-157, (2011); Awan U., Effects of buyer-supplier relationship on social performance improvement and innovation performance improvement, International Journal of Applied Management Science, 11, 1, pp. 21-35, (2019); Awan U., Kraslawski A., Huiskonen J., The impact of relational governance on performance improvement in export manufacturing firms, Journal of Industrial Engineering and Management, 11, 3, pp. 349-370, (2018); Awan U., Sroufe R., Kraslawski A., Creativity enables sustainable development: Supplier engagement as a boundary condition for the positive effect on green innovation, Journal of Cleaner Production, 226, pp. 172-185, (2019); Bach T.M., Dalazen L.L., da Silva W.V., Ferraresi A.A., da Veiga C.P., Relationship between innovation and performance in private companies: systematic literature review, Sage Open, 9, 2, pp. 1-17, (2019); Baker W.E., Sinkula J.M., The complementary effects of market orientation and entrepreneurial orientation on profitability in small businesses, Journal of Small Business Management, 47, 4, pp. 443-464, (2009); Bamel N., Kumar S., Bamel U., Lim W.M., Sureka R., The state of the art of innovation management: insights from a retrospective review of the European Journal of Innovation Management, European Journal of Innovation Management, ahead-of-print, ahead-of-print, (2022); Berthon P., Hulbert J.M., Pitt L.F., To serve or create?

Using a unique database of sixty-two large Latin American multinationals (multilatinas), we illustrate that the strong brands of emerging multinationals interact with institutional uncertainty in the host market to shape the firms’ innovation orientation. We confirm the robustness of the results, by using secondary data on foreign direct investments, advertising, and R&D investments. The implications of our findings for managers of multinational companies are clear: While strong brands enhance the innovation orientation of emerging multinationals, conditions of institutional uncertainty in host markets weaken this relationship. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Brands; Emerging multinationals; Innovation orientation; Institutional uncertainty","","Aaker D.A., Measuring brand equity across products and markets, California Management Review, 38, 3, pp. 102-120, (1996); Aaker D.A., Innovation: Brand it and love it, California Management Review, 50, 1, pp. 135-143, (1997); Aaker D.A., Innovation: Brand it or Lose it, California Management Review, 50, 1, pp. 8-24, (2007); Acemoglu D., Linn J., Market size in innovation: Theory and evidence from the pharmaceutical industry, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 119, 3, pp. 1049-1090, (2004); Acs Z.J., Audretsch D.B., Innovation, Market Structure, and Firm Size, The Review of Economics and Statistics, 69, 4, (1987); Aiken L.S., West S.G., Multiple regression: Testing and interpreting interactions, (1991); Akaka M.A., Vargo S.L., Lusch R.F., The Complexity of Context: A Service Ecosystems Approach for International Marketing, Journal of International Marketing, 21, 4, pp. 1-20, (2013); Alcacer J., Oxley J., Learning by supplying, Strategic Management Journal, 35, 2, pp. 204-223, (2014); Alm J., Jackson B., McKee M., Institutional Uncertainty and Taxpayer Compliance, The American Economic Review, 82, 4, pp. 1018-1026, (1992); Al-Mutawa F.S., Consumer-Generated Representations: Muslim Women Recreating Western Luxury Fashion Brand Meaning through Consumption, Psychology & Marketing, 30, 3, pp. 236-246, (2013); Anand J., Delios A., Absolute and relative resources as determinants of international acquisitions, Strategic Management Journal, 23, 2, pp. 119-134, (2002); Andonova V., Losada-Otalora M., Multilatinas: Strategies for Internationalisation, (2017); Aulakh P.S., Emerging multinationals from developing economies: Motivations, paths and performance, Journal of International Management, 13, 3, pp. 235-240, (2007); Azar G., Drogendijk R., Cultural distance, innovation and export performance: An examination of perceived and objective cultural distance, European Business Review, 28, 2, pp. 176-207, (2016); Barney J.B., Firm Resources and Sustained Competitive Advantage, Journal of Management, 17, 1, pp. 99-120, (1991); Barrick M.R., Thurgood G.R., Smith T.A., Courtright S.H., Collective organizational engagement: Linking motivational antecedents, strategic implementation, and firm performance, Academy of Management Journal, 58, 1, pp. 111-135, (2015); Belderbos R., Du H.S., Slangen A., When do firms choose global cities as foreign investment locations within countries?

Design/methodology/approach: Hierarchical linear regression modeling presents the linear relations at two decision layers of start-ups, their founders and managers. Data is collected and analyzed from 233 new ventures in Turkey. Findings: Findings of the two and three-way interaction analyses indicate a positive relationship between human capital and innovation capability when social capital and IO are high; however, the relation turns off when low. Research limitations/implications: The study extends the previous works on the proposed link between intellectual capital (IC) resources and innovation, by confirming the moderating role of social capital and IO on the positive association between human capital resources and innovation capability. Practical implications: The results show that for start-up companies, the co-existence of strong social capital and the strategic orientation towards innovation is required for the effective utilization of human capital for generating innovation capability within the organization. Thus, this study highlights the importance of networks, alliances and social relationships, together with the unification of strategic thinking, organizational learning and a culture of innovation for attaining innovation goals, which are crucial for the survival and success of these units. Originality/value: This study presents the first model in the literature which examines the moderating effects of IO and social capital on the human capital-innovation capability relationship. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Human capital; Innovation capability; Innovation orientation; Intellectual capital; New ventures; Social capital","","Abbas S.M., Liu Z., Orchestrating frugal eco-innovation: the plethora of challenges and diagnostics in lean startups of emerging economies, Innovation and Management Review, 19, 4, pp. 339-367, (2021); Adler P.S., Kwon S.W., Social capital: prospects for a new concept, Academy of Management Review, 27, 1, pp. 17-40, (2002); Agostini L., Nosella A., Filippini R., Does intellectual capital allow improving innovation performance?

The validity concern is caused primarily by the innovation dimension. We adopt a critical lens to evaluate the dimensions and associated measures of EO and contribute to the ongoing conversation on EO, by empirically testing its indicators and measures. Data collected from 404 firms in Oman are analysed using a two-step approach, initially conducting EFA and CFA tests, followed by structural equation modelling. The results suggest that innovation orientation significantly improves the clarity of the innovation dimension and is more congruent with EO's conceptualisation. The study further clarifies that EO consists of enabling measures that contribute to the generation of entrepreneurial outputs in corporations. The five-factor EO construct is specified formatively and a comprehensive list of measures is drawn from multiple scales associated with EO research.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors used data from 1,850 firms to determine the barriers associated with information and internal capabilities, risks and environment. Findings: The main results of this study confirm that potentially innovative firms of low technological intensity are more likely to ascribe high importance to obstacles associated with information and internal capabilities, when compared with innovative firms. The abandonment of innovative projects, family-operated enterprises and investment in R&D are all related to an increased perception of obstacles to innovation, while investments in information and communication technologies have an opposite effect. Variables as partnerships and export behaviour, have different effects depending on the level of technological intensity. Originality/value: This study investigates the obstacles to innovation of a firm as determined by its characteristics and as measured against its level of technological intensity. Previous studies have investigated barriers to innovation in technologically advanced sectors (Lachman and López, 2019) and technology-based SMEs (De Moraes Silva et al. 2020) or how the technological intensity of the firm determines access to university knowledge for overcoming barriers (Kanama and Nishikawa, 2017). The only study to analyse barriers to innovation by measuring a firm’s technological intensity was conducted into Mexican manufacturing and services sector companies by Santiago et al. (2017). © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Barriers to innovation; Innovation orientation; Innovation survey; Manufacturing firms; Obstacles to innovation; Technological intensity","","Aguilar-Barcelo J.G., Higuera-Cota F., Los retos en la gestión de la innovación Para América Latina y el caribe: un análisis de eficiencia, Revista de La Cepal, 2019, 127, pp. 7-26, (2019); Alvarez R., Grazzi M., Innovation and entrepreneurship in Latin America: what do we know?

Also, this study identifies how adaptive marketing capabilities (AMCs) enrich superior innovativeness and speed-to-market regarding innovation orientation and marketing orientation as the two critical functions. Design/methodology/approach: A questionnaire-based research was performed to test the proposed hypotheses. The data were collected from predominately marketing or research and development managers/senior specialists in 247 firms. Findings: Strategic orientations that cover market and innovation orientation facilitate a firm’s AMCs, positively affecting its innovativeness and speed-to-market. Also, AMCs mediate the relationship between strategic orientations, and innovativeness, and speed-to-market. Further, this study confirms the complementary association of AMC-related variables in enhancing firm innovativeness and speed-to-market. Research limitations/implications: This study is subject to the limitations inherent in survey design, particularly convenient sampling and single informants. Originality/value: This study broadens understanding of dynamic capabilities theory by examining how marketing capabilities can be enhanced and examined from an adaptive perspective for firms. This study also presents a model for the potential relationships among strategic orientations, AMCs, innovativeness and speed-to-market. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Adaptability; Dynamic capabilities; Innovation; Marketing capability; Marketing strategy; Strategic orientations","","Akgun A.E., Byrne J.C., Lynn G.S., Keskin H., New product development in turbulent environments: impact of improvisation and unlearning on new product performance, Journal of Engineering and Technology Management, 24, 3, pp. 203-230, (2007); Akgun A.E., Lynn G.S., New product development team improvisation and speed-to-market: an extended model, European Journal of Innovation Management, 5, 3, pp. 117-129, (2002); Anderson J., Gerbing D., Structural equation modeling in practice: a review and recommended two-step approach, Psychological Bulletin, 103, 3, pp. 411-423, (1988); Atuahene-Gima K., Slater S.F., Olson E.M., The contingent value of responsive and proactive market orientations for new product program performance, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 22, 6, pp. 464-482, (2005); Avlonitis G.J., Gounaris S.P., Marketing orientation and its determinants: an empirical analysis, European Journal of Marketing, 33, 11-12, pp. 1003-1037, (1999); Baird C.H., Parasnis G., From social media to social customer relationship management, Strategy & Leadership, 39, 5, pp. 30-37, (2011); Berry L., Cultivating service Brand equity, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 28, 1, pp. 128-137, (2000); BradnerOverby L., Wise J., Adaptive Brand marketing: rethinking your approach to brands in the digital age, (2009); Cake D.A., Agrawal V., Gresham G., Johansen D., Di Benedetto A., Strategic orientations, marketing capabilities and radical innovation launch success, Journal of Business & Industrial Marketing), 35, 10, (2020); Cao G., Tian N., Enhancing customer-linking marketing capabilities using marketing analytics, Journal of Business & Industrial Marketing, 35, 7, pp. 1289-1299, (2020); Cao G., Tian N., Blankson C., Big data, marketing analytics, and firm marketing capabilities, Journal of Computer Information Systems, pp. 1-10, (2021); Choudhury M.M., Harrigan P., CRM to social CRM: the integration of new technologies into customer relationship management, Journal of Strategic Marketing, 22, 2, pp. 149-176, (2014); da Silveira C., Lages C., Simoes C., Reconceptualizing brand identity in a dynamic environment, Journal of Business Research, 66, 1, pp. 28-36, (2013); Day G., Closing the marketing capabilities gap, Journal of Marketing, 75, 4, pp. 183-195, (2011); Dutta S., Zbaracki M.J., Bergen M., Pricing process as a capability: a resource-based perspective, Strategic Management Journal, 24, 7, pp. 615-630, (2003); Enyinda C.I., Opute A.P., Fadahunsi A., Mbah C.H., Marketing-sales-service interface and social media marketing influence on B2B sales process, Journal of Business and Industrial Marketing, 36, 6, pp. 990-1009, (2020); Floreddu P.B., Cabiddu F., Innovating distribution channels for competitive advantage, in XXV Convegno annuale di Sinergie, L’innovazione per la competitività delle imprese.

Based on observations of 2903 solo founders of new ventures in Germany in 2008–2017, we offer first and robust evidence that late-career entrepreneurs (~50 years and above) are more likely than younger founders to introduce product/service innovations that are ‘new to the market’. Our explorations specifically reveal that older founders who draw on personal financial resources and combine their innovation orientation with prior managerial experience are most likely to generate the types of innovations that bring new products or services to the market. We conclude by discussing how our study's insights contribute to the research agenda on innovations in late-career entrepreneurship. © 2023 The Authors","Age; Aging; Career; Entrepreneurship; Innovation","Age; Business activities; Career; Entrepreneurship; Financial resources; Innovation; Managerial experiences; Most likely; New ventures; Product/service innovations","Ai C., Norton E.C., Interaction terms in logit and probit models, Econ.

Despite this, a shared definition and a common view regarding this concept are still missing. The purpose of this paper is to shed light on innovation orientation (IO). On the basis of relevant literature, we investigate IO with specific reference to Italian small and medium enterprises producing building materials. Following the Benzécri's data analysis approach, characterised by applying in sequence multiple correspondence analysis and cluster analysis, we identify factors which best describe the phenomenon and define a typology of innovation orientations. The paper has important implications for both researchers and practitioners. It can contribute to addressing further research, highlighting the most significant indicators and dimensions of IO. It can also be helpful to practitioners, in order to understand which aspects to emphasise, with the objective of increasing the IO of the firm.

An initial model was developed to accomplish this, followed by validation and finalization of the cloud business intelligence model. Additionally, this research employs a mixed-techniques approach, including both qualitative and quantitative methods. This paper aims to achieve the following objectives: (1) Recognize the Cloud business intelligence concepts. (2) Identify the role of cloud BI in SMEs. (3) Identify the factors that affect the design and presenting a Cloud business intelligence model based on critical factors affecting SMEs during pandemic COVID-19. (4) Discuss the importance of Cloud BI in pandemic COVID-19 for SMEs. (5) Provide managerial implications for using Cloud BI effectively in Iran’s SMEs. Design/methodology/approach: In the current study, an initial model was first proposed, and the cloud business intelligence model was then validated and finalized. Moreover, this study uses a mixed-methods design in which both qualitative and quantitative methods are used. The fuzzy Delphi Method has been applied for parameter validation purposes, and eventually, the Cloud business intelligence model has been presented through exploiting the interpretive structural modeling. The partial least squares method was also applied to validate the model. Data were also analyzed using the MAXQDA and Smart PLS software package. Findings: In this research, from the elimination of synonym and frequently repeated factors and classification of final factors, six main factors, 24 subfactors and 24 identifiers were discovered from the texts of the relevant papers and interviews conducted with 19 experts in the area of BI and Cloud computing. The main factors of our research include drivers, enablers, competencies, critical success factors, SME characteristics and adoption. The subfactors of included competitors pressure, decision-making time, data access, data analysis and calculations, budget, clear view, clear missions, BI tools, data infrastructure, information merging, business key sector, data owner, business process, data resource, data quality, IT skill, organizational preparedness, innovation orientation, SME characteristics, SME activity, SME structure, BI maturity, standardization, agility, balances between BI systems and business strategies. Then, the quantitative part continued with the fuzzy Delphi technique in which two factors, decision-making time and agility, were deleted in the first round, and the second round was conducted for the rest of the factors. In that step, 24 factors were assessed based on the opinions of 19 experts. In the second round, none of the factors were removed, and thus the Delphi analysis was concluded. Next, data analysis was carried out by building the structural self-interaction matrix to present the model. According to the results, adoptability is a first-level or dependent variable. Regarding the results of interpretive structural modeling (ISM), the variable of critical success factors is a second-level variable. Enablers, competencies and SME characteristics are the third-level and most effective variables of the model. Accordingly, the initial model of Cloud BI for SMEs is presented as follows: The results of ISM revealed the impact of SME characteristics on BI critical success factors and adoptability. Since this category was not an underlying category of BI; thus, it played the role of a moderating variable for the impact of critical success factors on adoptability in the final model. Research limitations/implications: Since this study is limited to about 100 SMEs in the north of Iran, results should be applied cautiously to SMEs in other countries. Generalizing the study's results to other industries and geographic regions should be done with care since management perceptions, and financial condition of a business vary significantly. Additionally, the topic of business intelligence in SMEs constrained the sample from the start since not all SMEs use business intelligence systems, and others are unaware of their advantages. BI tools enable the effective management of companies of all sizes by providing analytic data and critical performance indicators. In general, SMEs used fewer business intelligence technologies than big companies. According to studies, SMEs understand the value of simplifying their information resources to make critical business choices. Additionally, they are aware of the market's abundance of business intelligence products. However, many SMEs lack the technical knowledge necessary to choose the optimal tool combination. In light of the frequently significant investment required to implement BI approaches, a viable alternative for SMEs may be to adopt cloud computing solutions that enable organizations to strengthen their systems and information technologies on a pay-per-use basis while also providing access to cutting-edge BI technologies at a reasonable price. Practical implications: Before the implementation of Cloud BI in SMEs, condition of driver, competency and critical success factor of SMEs should also be considered. These will help to define the significant resources and skills that form the strategic edge and lead to the success of Cloud BI projects. Originality/value: Most of the previous studies have been focused on factors such as critical success factors in cloud business intelligence and cloud computing in small and medium-sized enterprises, cloud business intelligence adoption models, the services used in cloud business intelligence, the factors involved in acceptance of cloud business intelligence, the challenges and advantages of cloud business intelligence, and drivers and barriers to cloud business intelligence. None of the studied resources proposed any comprehensive model for designing and implementing cloud business intelligence in small and medium-sized enterprises; they only investigated some of the aspects of this issue. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business intelligence;

These contradictions motivated this study. Specifically, this study sought to examine the relationship between innovation orientation and firms’ financial performance. The study also assessed the moderating effect of new product development on the relationship between innovation orientation and firms’ financial performance. Data from 200 manufacturing firms in Ghana were quantitatively analysed using SPSS. Moderated hierarchical regression test was carried out to examine the relationships between the constructs. While a positive relationship between innovation orientation and the financial performance of firms was established, the study findings revealed that new product development capabilities have no moderating effect on the relationship between innovation and firms’ financial performance. The study contributes to the innovation orientation and financial performance literature. It extends our knowledge of how new product development influences the innovation orientation-financial performance relationship of firms. © 2023 The Author(s).

The SDGs mark a new path for the planning processes of the different actors working for development, expanding their goals, proposing an update of the roles they must play, and defining new frameworks for relationships and spaces for action. Non-governmental development organizations (NGDOs), whose traditional mission focused on reducing the poverty gap, defending human rights, or promoting environmental protection, must be able to respond satisfactorily to these new challenges, pass beyond their classic positions, and adapt to an increasingly complex and turbulent global context. Achieving high impact in the SDGs requires development organizations to be more agile and innovative. With the intention of bringing visibility to the importance that innovation can play in the success and results achieved by development cooperation organizations, the main objective of this study was to validate, through a sample of Spanish NGDOs, a causal model that represents the positive contribution which innovation orientation generates in the result of the activity of these entities. This research concludes by confirming that innovation orientation favors the attainment of a higher degree of success in the projects and actions carried out by non-profit entities which promote the SDGs, which has a direct and positive impact on the performance they achieve.

Particularly, customer interactions in B2B services that were once sustained by the “people mix” now demand a huge overhaul in light of the “new normal” restrictions. Hence, the purpose of this study is to explore how B2B service firms can engender firm value through virtual customer interactions during and in the post-COVID-19 era from an SME’s perspective. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopts an exploratory qualitative inquiry to contribute to this discourse by proposing a conceptual framework based on prior literature and relevant theoretical frameworks, as well as qualitative interviews with SME managers, CEOs and/or owner-managers. Findings: The qualitative findings reveal organizational preparedness, empathy, digital content and trust as key enablers of effective B2B virtual interaction that enhances cocreated value, thereby augmenting firm value. This study offers a much-needed examination of virtual interaction in B2B contexts and proposes a business customer virtual interaction model. Research limitations/implications: The exploratory nature of this study is one limitation, and future studies with a bigger representative sample size that uses survey or experimental data drawn from large enterprises might add value to the current findings. Also, while this study is conducted in dynamic markets due to the COVID-19 crisis, future research must examine the customer/firm’s experiences in other forms of crises-led market ecosystems. Practical implications: B2B service firms must be strongly inclined to continuously take steps to develop and maintain virtual interaction with customers. Proactive efforts to familiarize internal and external stakeholders with virtual interaction platforms are a crucial step for effective customer engagement. The effectiveness of B2B virtual interactions can be strengthened through digital content that elicits trust and exhibits empathy, especially in crises led-markets. Also, the value created for the firm must be redeployed strategically to sustain positive customer engagement behaviors that continue to deliver value to the firm and the customer. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the increasing B2B customer engagement literature by exploring the ongoing dialogue on how B2B firms can strive and succeed in the post-COVID-19 era or related crises-led market ecosystems through enhanced virtual B2B customer interaction efforts. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","B2B customer engagement; Business customer cocreated value; Business customer virtual interaction; Service innovation capability; Service innovation orientation; SMEs","","Aarikka-Stenroos L., Jaakkola E., Value co-creation in knowledge intensive business services: a dyadic perspective on the joint problem solving process, Industrial Marketing Management, 41, 1, pp. 15-26, (2012); An M., Han S., Effects of experiential motivation and customer engagement on customer value creation: analysis of psychological process in the experience-based retail environment, Journal of Business Research, 120, pp. 389-397, (2020); Anaza N.A., Inyang A.E., Saavedra J.L., Empathy and affect in B2B salesperson performance, Journal of Business & Industrial Marketing, 33, 1, pp. 29-41, (2018); Anderson J.C., Narus J.A., A model of distributor firm and manufacturer firm working partnerships, Journal of Marketing, 54, 1, pp. 42-58, (1990); Anderson A.R., Wallace C., Townsend L., Great expectations or small country living?

This study, rooted in a comprehensive evaluation of dynamic capabilities and innovation orientation, introduces a framework that could serve as a valuable resource for subsequent research. It contributes to the global discourse on optimizing digital supply chain practices among SMEs. Quantitative method was employed, gathering data from 212 professionals in SMEs in Dubai, UAE, via an online questionnaire. The collected data were analyzed using SmartPLS 4, focusing on reliability, validity, discriminant validity, and hypothesis testing. The findings show a significant influence of innovation orientation on the digital supply chain. Dynamic capabilities also exhibit an indirect yet substantial impact on the relationship between innovation orientation and the digital supply chain. The identified dynamic capabilities are instrumental in refining decisions associated with the circular economy and leveraging technology to enhance supply chain mechanisms. These capabilities foster positive correlations between the digital supply chain and innovation. The predominant advantage of digital supply chains for consumers lies in their agility and speed, facilitating swift response to customer demand and bolstering business efficiency. The model presented is a template for future research, which could expand its scope to include other industries like manufacturing or services, augmenting the robustness of the findings. © 2024 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.","Digital Supply Chain; Dynamic Capabilities; Innovation Orientation; SMEs","","Abudaqa A., Hilmi M.

The strategy of organisational ambidexterity in balancing technological and relational social capital factors between buyers and suppliers leads to a higher level of digital manufacturing capabilities and enhances buyers’ innovation potential, considering the sustainable practices in their processes to cope with Industry 4.0 manufacturing processes and sustainability challenges. The study empirically validates the model using data collected from 379 French manufacturing companies. This is the first study that examines how buyers perceive the role of blockchain technology in exploring and exploiting innovation management in the Industry 4.0 era. The study advances understanding on the theory of ambidexterity of supply chains in buyer–supplier relationships. The study results show the positive effect between internal integration and blockchain technology as well as relational social capital factors in buyer–supplier relationships. The findings underscore the critical role of relational and technological capital in buyer–supplier relationships, specifically to act as a catalyst for exploiting internal capabilities to achieve the innovation targets. The unique findings state blockchain technology mediation is dominant in exploiting the internal capabilities and benefits buyers' innovation orientation. © 2021","Blockchain technology; Buyer innovation; Industry 4.0; Relational capital; Supply chain ambidexterity; Sustainability","France; Blockchain; Economic and social effects; Industry 4.0; Product development; Sales; Sustainable development; Block-chain; Blockchain technology; Buyer innovation; Buyer-supplier relationships; New product development; Relational capital; Social capitals; Social factor; Supply chain ambidexterity; Technology factors; consumer-resource interaction; innovation; manufacturing; product development; social capital; software; supply chain management; sustainability; Supply chains","Adler P.S., Kwon S.W., Social capital: prospects for a new concept, Acad.

Therefore, this study draws on the valuable theoretical underpinnings of the resource-based view and information processing theory to examine the mechanism through which an organization's innovation orientation (IO) and team unlearning (TU) can impact new product development (NPD) success. Design/methodology/approach: A causal model was developed in order to analyze the role of innovation orientation and team unlearning on NPD success. This proposed model and several hypotheses were gauged using data from 255 NPD team members from Taiwanese high-tech and traditional companies. Findings: The results indicate that both IO and TU relate to outcomes. Specifically, this study demonstrates that it is insufficient that firms simply establish the configurations needed to enhance their IO and TU, firms also need to find out the correct mechanism to enhance NPD success. The relationships between IO, TU and NPD success were fully mediated by team information processing. Originality/value: This report sheds light on the importance of innovation orientation and team unlearning in today's NPD process and uncovers the underlying mechanism through which IO and TU contribute to NPD success. It also offers precise advice for the assessment of management of team information-processing to boost the performance of new products. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Innovation orientation; NPD success; Team information processing; Team unlearning","","Adam M., Day G., Dougherty D., Enhancing new product development performance: an organizational learning perspective, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 15, 5, pp. 403-422, (1998); Akgun A.E., Lynn G.S., Reilly R., Multi-dimensionality of learning in new product development teams, European Journal of Innovation Management, 5, pp. 57-72, (2002); Akgun A.E., Lynn G.S., Byrne J.C., Organizational learning: a socio-cognitive framework, Human Relations, 56, 7, pp. 839-868, (2003); Akgun A.E., Lynn G.S., Yilmaz C., Learning process in new product development teams and effects on product success: a socio-cognitive perspective, Industrial Marketing Management, 35, 2, pp. 210-224, (2006); Akgun A.E., Lynn G.S., Byrne J.C., Antecedents and consequences of unlearning in new product development teams, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 23, 1, pp. 73-88, (2006); Akgun A.E., Byrne J.C., Lynn G.S., Keskin H., New product development in turbulent environments: impact of improvisation and unlearning on new product performance, Journal of Engineering and Technology Management, 24, 3, pp. 203-230, (2007); Akgun A., Keskin H., Lynn G., Dogan D., Antecedents and consequences of team sensemaking capability in product development projects, R&D Management, 42, 5, pp. 473-493, (2012); Akgun A.E., Lynn G.S., Keskin H., Dogan D., Team learning in IT implementation projects: antecedents and consequences, International Journal of Information Management, 34, 1, pp. 37-47, (2014); Anderson J.C., Gerbing D.W., Structural equation modeling in practice: a review and recommended two-step approach, Psychological Bulletin, 103, 3, pp. 411-423, (1988); Anderson R.C., Reeb D.M., Board composition: balancing family influence in S&P 500 firms, Administrative Science Quarterly, 49, 2, pp. 209-237, (2004); Assink M., Inhibitors of disruptive innovation capability: a conceptual model, European Journal of Innovation Management, 9, pp. 215-233, (2006); Atuahene-Gima K., Resolving the capability—rigidity paradox in new product innovation, Journal of Marketing, 69, 4, pp. 61-83, (2005); Acikgoz A., Gunsel A., Kuzey C., Zaim H., Team foresight in new product development projects, Group Decision and Negotiation, 25, 2, pp. 289-323, (2016); Bagozzi R.P., Yi Y., On the evaluation of structural equation models, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 16, 1, pp. 74-94, (1988); Bagozzi R.P., Yi Y., Phillips L.W., Assessing construct validity in organizational research, Administrative Science Quarterly, 36, pp. 421-458, (1991); Baker W.E., Sinkula J.M., The synergistic effect of market orientation and learning orientation on organizational performance, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 27, 4, pp. 411-427, (1999); Barney J., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage, Journal of Marketing, 17, 1, pp. 99-120, (1991); Baum J., Wally S., Strategic decision speed and firm performance, Strategic Management Journal, 24, 11, pp. 1107-1129, (2003); Becker K., Facilitating unlearning during implementation of new technology, Journal of Organizational Change Management, 23, pp. 251-268, (2010); Bell S.J., Whitwell G.J., Lukas B.A., Schools of thought in organizational learning, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 30, 1, pp. 70-86, (2002); Berthon P., Hulbert J.M., Pitt L.F., To serve or create?

However, studies explore service innovation orientation, open innovation and innovation performance in context of medium and small private hospitals are scarce. The main objective of the study is to investigate the relationship between service innovation orientation, open innovation and innovation performance in medium and small private hospitals in India. A quantitative study using cross-sectional survey method was performed and the data were collected from 173 medium and small private hospitals in three northern states in India using purposive sampling. The findings suggest that there is a positive relationship between service innovation orientation and open innovation. It also shows that there is a positive relationship between open innovation and innovation performance. The findings also reveal that open innovation mediates the relationship between service innovation orientation and innovation performance.

With no or very few studies investigating employee learning and development adaptation in SMEs, we address an important research gap. Research Design & Methods: We tested the hypothesized relationships on a sample of 214 Polish SMEs. Data was collected using the computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) method. The logit model and ordered probit model were employed to analyse the data. Findings: While the results clearly indicate that innovation orientation had an impact on the adaptation of training and development for Polish SMEs during the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, internationalization did not exhibit any significant impact on the number of training sessions conducted during the first year of Covid-19. However, the existence of prior experience with online technologies may have moderated the relationship between internationalization and adaptation of learning and development. Implications & Recommendations: To become quick adapters, SMEs should develop an innovation orienta-tion, implement online learning practices and foster mutual learning within the organization, and take every opportunity to learn from external partners. Contribution & Value Added: With this study, we contribute to the body of knowledge investigating SME adaptation during Covid-19. This research implies that innovation orientation can positively influence how firms adapt their training and development in times of crisis. This pioneering contribution is an important piece of the puzzle of what might determine the competitive advantage of some SMEs over others in years to come. © 2023, Cracow University of Economics.

The authors aim to answer the following simple yet important questions: how do SMEs with market orientation (MO) and those with entrepreneurial orientation (EO) differ in terms of innovation performance? Do MO and EO have conflicting effects on the process of innovation at SMEs? If so, how does this conflict affect the innovation performance of SMEs? Design/methodology/approach: This study explores the effects of MO and EO on different types of technological innovation among SMEs using data collected from 124 INNOBIZ-certified manufacturing SMEs in South Korea. Logistic regression analysis and moderated regression analysis were conducted to test the hypotheses. Findings: The empirical results demonstrate that MO and EO engender different kinds of technological innovations. MO stimulates “new-to-the-firm” product innovation, while EO drives “new-to-the-industry” innovation in processes and products. Furthermore, SMEs' overall innovation performance will suffer from the conflicting interplay between MO and EO. Originality/value: The findings of this study encourage SMEs to concentrate SMEs' resources and learning efforts on one specific innovation orientation and only then to develop SMEs' ambidextrous managerial capabilities. This study offers academic contributions in that the study overcomes the limitations of past studies on the strategic orientation of SMEs by empirically confirming the dilemmas faced by SMEs and expands the theoretical understanding of the relationship between MO and EO. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Entrepreneurial orientation; Innovation; Market orientation; Small and medium-sized enterprises","","Aiken L.S., West S.G., Multiple Regression: Testing and Interpreting Interactions, (1991); Anderson E., Gerbing D.W., Structural equation modeling in practice: a review and recommended two-step approach, Psychological Bulletin, 103, 3, pp. 411-423, (1988); Atuahene-Gima K., Ko A., An empirical investigation of the effect of market orientation and entrepreneurship orientation alignment on product innovation, Organization Science, 12, 1, pp. 54-74, (2001); Aydin H., Market orientation and product innovation: the mediating role of technological capability, European Journal of Innovation Management, 24, 4, pp. 1233-1267, (2021); Baker W.E., Sinkula J.M., Market orientation and the new product paradox, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 22, pp. 483-502, (2005); Baker W.E., Sinkula J.M., The complementary effects of market orientation and entrepreneurial orientation on profitability in small business, Journal of Small Business Management, 47, 4, pp. 443-464, (2009); Bhuian S.N., Menguc B., Bell S.J., Just entrepreneurial enough: the moderating effect of entrepreneurship on the relationship between market orientation and performance, Journal of Business Research, 58, pp. 9-17, (2005); Bigliardi B., The effect of innovation on financial performance: a research study involves SMEs, Innovation: Management, Policy and Practice, 15, 2, pp. 245-255, (2013); Byrne B., Structural Equation Modeling with AMOS: Basic Concepts, Applications, and Programming, (2009); Cakar N.D., Erturk A., Comparing innovation capability of small and medium-sized enterprises: examining the effects of organizational culture and empowerment, Journal of Small Business Management, 48, 3, pp. 325-359, (2010); Calantone R.J., Cavusgil S.T., Zhao Y., Learning orientation, firm innovation capability, and firm performance, Industrial Marketing Management, 31, 6, pp. 515-524, (2002); Carey S., Lawson B., Krause D.R., Social capital configuration, legal bonds and performance in buyer-supplier relationships, Journal of Operations Management, 29, 4, pp. 277-288, (2011); The top 12 reasons startups fail, CBinsights, (2021); Cohen W.M., Levinthal D.A., Absorptive capacity: a new perspective on learning and innovation, Administrative Science Quarterly, 35, 1, pp. 128-152, (1990); Cohen J., Cohen P., West S.G., Aiken L.S., Applied Multiple Regression/Correlation Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences, (2003); Covin J.G., Miles M.P., Corporate entrepreneurship and the pursuit of competitive advantage, Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, 23, 3, pp. 47-63, (1999); Covin J.G., Slevin D.P., Strategic management of small firms in hostile and benign environments, Strategic Management Journal, 10, pp. 75-87, (1989); Craighead C.W., Ketchen D.J., Dunn K., Hult G.T.M., Addressing common method variance: guidelines for survey research on information technology, operations and supply chain management, IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, 58, 3, pp. 578-588, (2011); Damanpour F., Organizational innovation: a meta-analysis of effects of determinants and moderators, Academy of Management Journal, 34, 3, pp. 555-590, (1991); De Luca L.M., Verona G., Vicari S., Market orientation and R&D effectiveness in high-technology firms: an empirical investigation in the Biotechnology industry, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 27, pp. 299-320, (2010); Dewar R.D., Dutton J.E., The adoption of radical and incremental innovations: an empirical analysis, Management Science, 32, 11, pp. 1422-1433, (1986); From 10-K, (2020); Durach C.F., Wiengarten F., Choi T.Y., Supplier-supplier cooperation and supply chain disruption: first-tier supplier resilience in the tetradic context, International Journal of Operations and Production Management, 40, 7-8, pp. 1041-1065, (2020); Eberhart A.C., Maxwell W.F., Siddique A.R., An examination of long-term abnormal stock returns and operating performance following R&D increase, The Journal of Finance, 59, 2, pp. 623-650, (2004); Eisenmann T., Why start-ups fail?

In addition, studies of the impact of changes in strategic aspects as BGs mature on BG performance and survival have yielded conflicting results. To address this gap in knowledge, the present study examines the relationships between intelligence generation and innovation orientation, and branding strategies as moderated by maturity. The data were received from 133 senior managers of BGs of various ages. The analysis shows that BG maturity negatively moderates the relationship between intelligence generation and functional branding strategy but does not influence the relationships of innovation orientation with branding strategies. Furthermore, emotional branding showed stable association with both financial and market performance indicators. This study demonstrates that maturity affects the orientations and performance of BGs and calls for a reassessment of the competitive international strategy of BGs at the post-entry stage. © The Author(s) 2024.","Born global;

To protect the environment and maintain their own survival, organizations must strengthen their green innovation capabilities. Drawing on the recourse-based view and ecology modernization theory (EMT), this study examines the direct effect of green strategic orientations, green entrepreneurial orientation, green market orientation, green innovation orientation, and green organizational culture on the firm’s green innovation capability, as well as the mediating effect of green innovation capability on the relationship of these four factors and green innovation performance. Besides, this study also explored the moderating effects of green management system implementation and firm size on the association between green innovation capability and green innovation performance. To test the hypothesized model, a questionnaire survey was administered to gather responses from 293 medium-sized and large manufacturing firms operating in Pakistan. The partial least squares method was used for data analysis. The results revealed that green entrepreneurial orientation, green market orientation, green innovation orientation, and green organizational culture positively impacted green innovation capability, which subsequently positively influenced green innovation performance. Moreover, effective implementation of green management systems can bolster the effect of green innovation capability on green innovation performance, and the mediating effect of green innovation capability has also been confirmed. These indicated that the management of medium and large manufacturing firms operating in Pakistan should focus on encouraging green innovation and training employees regarding the latest eco-friendly technologies to attain performance and sustainable development goals. Policymakers should implement green business development programs and offer rewards or penalties for promoting compliance. The present study contributes greatly to the literature by applying EMT as an alternative to address the mediating role of green innovation capability and the moderating effect of green management system implementation in enhancing firms’ green innovation performance. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Green culture; Green innovation capabilities; Green innovation performance; Green management system; Green orientation","Commerce; Data Analysis; Ecology; Humans; Organizational Culture; Pakistan; Pakistan; business development; environmental protection; firm size; green economy; innovation; least squares method; management practice; manufacturing; Sustainable Development Goal; commercial phenomena; data analysis; ecology; human; organizational culture; Pakistan","Abbas J., Dogan E., The impacts of organizational green culture and corporate social responsibility on employees’ responsible behaviour towards the society, Environ Sci Pollut Res, 29, 40, pp. 60024-60034, (2022); Al-Hakimi M.A., Al-Swidi A.K., Gelaidan H.M., Mohammed A., The influence of green manufacturing practices on the corporate sustainable performance of SMEs under the effect of green organizational culture: a moderated mediation analysis, J Clean Prod, 376, (2022); Andersen J., A relational natural-resource-based view on product innovation: the influence of green product innovation and green suppliers on differentiation advantage in small manufacturing firms, Technovation, 104, (2021); Arzubiaga U., Kotlar J., De Massis A., Maseda A., Iturralde T., Entrepreneurial orientation and innovation in family SMEs: unveiling the (actual) impact of the board of directors, J Bus Ventur, 33, 4, pp. 455-469, (2018); Asadi S., Pourhashemi S.O., Nilashi M., Abdullah R., Samad S., Yadegaridehkordi E., Aljojo N., Razali N.S., Investigating influence of green innovation on sustainability performance: a case on Malaysian hotel industry, J Clean Prod, 258, (2020); Audretsch D.B., Belitski M., Guerrero M., Sustainable orientation management and institutional quality: looking into European entrepreneurial innovation ecosystems, Technovation, 124, (2023); Barney J., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage, J Manag, 17, 1, pp. 99-120, (1991); Borah P.S., Dogbe C.S., Pomegbe W.W., Bamfo B.A., Hornuvo L.K., Green market orientation, green innovation capability, green knowledge acquisition and green brand positioning as determinants of new product success, Eur J Innov Manag, 26, 2, pp. 364-385, (2021); Bresciani S., Rehman S.U., Alam G.M., Ashfaq K., Usman M., Environmental MCS package, perceived environmental uncertainty and green performance: In Green dynamic capabilities and investment in environmental management perspectives, Rev Int Bus Strat, 33, 1, pp. 105-126, (2022); Cai W., Li G., The drivers of eco-innovation and its impact on performance: evidence from China, J Clean Prod, 176, pp. 110-118, (2018); Cain M.K., Zhang Z., Yuan K.-H., Univariate and multivariate skewness and kurtosis for measuring non-normality: prevalence, influence, and estimation, Behav Res Methods, 49, 5, pp. 1716-1735, (2017); Chang K.-H., Gotcher D.F., How and when does co-production facilitate eco-innovation in international buyer-supplier relationships?

As a result, these advances are putting pressure on the retail sector to find new and efficient solutions to boost retail and customer experience. Meanwhile, in Central Java, Indonesia, there is one specific SME type that is part of the nation's cultural heritage, namely Batik SME. This study aims to determine the effect of Intangible Assets and Innovation Orientation on the Competitive Advantages of Batik SMEs in Central Java, Indonesia. This study's method was an explanatory survey method with a type of decompression-verification study from primary data obtained from Batik SMEs and using PLS SEM in analyzing the data of the book. The results of this study indicate that Intangible Assets with Path coefficient (β) = 0.320, P value <0.001 (<α = 0.05), and Innovation Orientation with Path coefficient (β) = 0.28 P value <0.038 (<α = 0.05), have a positive effect on Competitive Advantage with coefficient (β) = 0.46, P value <0.001 (<α = 0.05). This result means that the better Intangible Assets would improve the Batik SME Competitive Advantage. Besides, the Orientation owned by Batik SME would increase the Competitive Advantage. Batik SME in Central Java should improve the quality of their Intangible Asset and Innovation Orientation to increase their Competitive Advantage.

However, it is not yet clear what constitute the profile of exporting SMEs and whether innovation orientation plays a role. To fill this important gap, our study adopts a configurational approach contending that a specific set of drivers makeup the profiles of exporting SMEs. Using the Classification and Regression Trees (CART) algorithm, we empirically show three distinctive exporting profiles for product, service, and process innovators, with varying magnitude and importance of export drivers. Our results show the most important export drivers for product, service and process innovators. While process innovators’ profile excludes process innovation, product and service innovators’ profiles include product and service innovation respectively. These results lead to major policy and managerial implications in relation to promoting exporting among SMEs given that the UK has left the European Union. © 2022 The Authors","Export; Innovation; Internationalisation;

The need to highlight the drivers of AL and its influence on EP necessitated this study. Design/methodology/approach: The authors subjected sample data set from 420 respondents that engage in direct and indirect export activities to inferential analysis using partial least square (SEM). Findings/results: This study reveals that innovation orientation mediates AL and EP, as the direct link was not significant and organisation trust moderates the relationship. Practical implications: Leaders' ambidexterity should incorporate a clearly defined orientation towards innovation that supports knowledge sharing and guides the need for innovative support while also ensuring that employees have high trust in the organisation. Originality/value: This study validates the leadership complexity theory and adds to EP literature on the relevance of innovation orientation and OT as good predictors of EP. Copyright: © 2022.

In addition, it examines the significant role that innovation plays in the overall performance of the biotechnology industry in France, which is the primary focus of the study. In particular, the current study also investigates the role that academic-industry collaboration plays in the relationship between innovation orientation, technology transfer, and organizational performance; the impact that technology transfer has on firm performance in the French biotech sector; and the impact that innovation orientation has on firm performance in the French biotech sector. Although the importance of research laboratories to the development of new technologies and the biotechnology industry as a whole, the scope of this study has focused on this particular level of investigation. By utilizing data from famous research centres located within French institutions that have received exceptionally high marks, this study helps fill the void left by earlier research. Questionnaires were issued to university research laboratories to collect data addressing the enhancement of knowledge transfer to the industry. The findings present a novel perspective on the influence of technology transfer on the success of biotechnology businesses in France and open up new research avenues that could be investigated in future work. © 2023 ThinkBiotech LLC.

In practice, a new sustainable entrepreneurial model called “digital sustainable entrepreneurship” (DSE) has emerged. Aiming to establish a DSE model based on digital capability (DC) and digital innovation orientation (DIO), this study explored what kind of digital capability could be built to lead to a boost in digital sustainable entrepreneurship, to realize the creation of social and environmental value. We also revealed how DC affected DSE by introducing DIO and discussed the moderating role played therein by the manager’s cognition of sustainable opportunities (MCSO). The study adopted CFA and SEM on the model using AMOS 27.0 and used the multiple regression analysis method to conduct an empirical study into the data from 308 SMEs in pollutive industries to validate the research framework. The results show a positive relationship between DC and DSE; DC is positively correlated to DIO; DIO is positively correlated to DSE; DIO plays a partial mediating role between DC and DSE; and MCSO positively moderates the relationship among DC, DIO, and DSE. This study will be of practical significance regarding how sustainable entrepreneurs can boost digital sustainable entrepreneurship. © 2022 by the authors.","digital capability; digital innovation orientation; digital sustainable entrepreneurship; managers’ cognition of sustainable opportunities; pollutive industry; SMEs","cognition; entrepreneur; innovation; multiple regression; numerical model; sustainability","Cohen B., Winn M.I., Market imperfections, opportunity and sustainable entrepreneurship, J.

We consider various aspects of an organisation like inward looking organisational emphasis, customer interface, competition driven organisational culture, organisational mindset, digitisation, digitalisation, digital transformation, organisational environment, leadership, emphasis on human resources and technology orientation that can aid in the process of innovativeness and innovation orientation of companies. A simple text mining exercise is proposed for the purpose and a revealed innovation advantage index is introduced to measure and rank companies in terms of innovativeness. We observe that companies, irrespective of their size, are lagging in terms of technology orientation, but their organisational orientation is strong. Specific insights emerge from the analysis regarding relation between innovativeness and growth, productivity and market perception.

However, the high level of novelty and uncertainty involved with eco-innovations requires additional knowledge and capabilities that go beyond the firm and that can be achieved through cooperation. Thus, it is crucial to analyse how cooperation affects the elements that drive eco-innovation. This study tests the impact of cooperation on the environmental orientation of companies while innovating using structural equation modelling with partial least squares and multigroup analysis and a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis for a sample of Spanish companies. Results suggest that companies that do not cooperate are less eco-innovation-oriented and show lower dependence on external information sources, although their impact on the orientation to product and process innovation is higher. This work leads to some theoretical conclusions and implications for researchers and practitioners. © 2022 The Authors.

Further, the aim of this paper is to understand the innovation culture among Kuwaiti family businesses and the innovation orientation concept and its importance for these businesses. Design/methodology/approach: The study will use a quantitative research methodology in order to investigate the relationship between independent variables: creativity, risk-taking, future orientation, openness to change and proactiveness with Kuwaiti business performance as a dependent variable. A well-structured questionnaire is distributed to 150 family businesses that operate in Kuwait, where 114 of the respondents responded positively. Structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis was used for evaluating the proposed model. Findings: The results show that creativity, risk-taking and future orientation have significant relationship with business performance, while openness to change and proactiveness do not have any significant relationship with business performance. Research limitations/implications: This research is conducted during the period of initial months of COVID-19 pandemic, March–July 2020 respectively, and responses might be influenced by the current situation. Originality/value: The correlation between family businesses and innovation orientation is not studied so far in Kuwait. There is a lack of studies about family business in general in Kuwait since there are only very few research studies. This is the first research about this topic that covers Kuwait as a country. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Creativity; Family business; Innovation orientation; Kuwait; Performance; Structural equation modeling","","Abdullah M.N., Family entrepreneurship and banking support in Kuwait: conventional vs Islamic banks, Journal of Family Business Management, (2020);

Specifically, this study introduces both a resource-based perspective that combines technology, human, and business resources to develop an e-service capability, and an innovation strategy that emphasizes service innovation orientation to examine information-value offering. This study also examines how firms bundle e-service capability and service innovation orientation to enhance information-value offering that enhances customer relationships and organizational performance. The results from a survey of 115 financial service firms in Taiwan highlight the importance of how e-service capability and service innovation orientation leads to information-value offering and that this value is shown to positively influence organizational performance by customer relationship performance. The results suggest that researchers and practitioners should pay special attention to the complementary resource-strategy that are needed to successfully implement e-service systems initiatives and that an emphasis on the resource or strategy alone may not be sufficient. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","e-service capability; e-service systems; Information-value offering; Service innovation orientation","Public relations; Business resources; Customer relationships; E- services; Financial service firms; Information value; Innovation strategy; Organizational performance; Service innovation; Innovation","Arvidsson V., Holmstrom J., Lyytinen K., Information systems use as strategy practice: a multi-dimensional view of strategic information system implementation and use, J.

This paper focuses on two long-term aspects of family businesses - their succession and their ability to innovate - defining innovativeness as an aspect of organisational culture. Based on ten case studies, the paper concludes that the values related to a firm's context, influenced by the divesting party as well as by the choice of successor, create inertia, to the extent that only minor changes in innovation orientation are possible. External owners may focus to a greater extent on growth and new ways of innovating, while family-succeeded firms diversify so as not to abandon previous businesses. Intermediating factors, such as customer involvement, type of SME, and the acquirers' motives, influence the innovative organisational culture and create explanatory links to innovation intensity and methodologies of innovation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Acquisition; Family business; Innovativeness; Manufacturing; SME; Succession","","Abdellatif M., Amann B., Jaussaud J., Family versus nonfamily business: A comparison of international strategies, Journal of Family Business Strategy, 1, 2, pp. 108-116, (2010); Ahuja G., Katila R., Technological acquisitions and the innovation performance of acquiring firms: A longitudinal study, Strategic Management Journal, 22, 3, pp. 197-219, (2001); Amabile T.M., Conti R., Coon H., Lazenby J., Herron M., Assessing the work environment for creativity, Academy of Management Journal, 39, 5, pp. 1154-1184, (1996); Andriopoulos C., Determinants of organisational creativity: A literature review, Management Decision, 39, 10, pp. 834-840, (2001); At C., Morand P.-H., The sale of small firms: A multidimensional analysis, Economic Theory, 22, pp. 927-933, (2003); Bessant J., von Stamm B., Moeslein K.M., Neyer A.-K., Backing outsiders: Selection strategies for discontinuous innovation, R&D Management, 40, 4, pp. 345-356, (2010); Birley S., Ng D., Godfrey A., The family and the business, Long Range Planning, 32, 6, pp. 598-608, (1999); Bjursell C., Cultural divergence in mergin family businesses, Journal of Family Business Strategy, 2, 2, pp. 69-77, (2011); Boeker W., Karichalil R., Entrepreneurial transition: Factors affecting founder departure, Academy of Management Journal, 45, 3, pp. 818-826, (2002); Chandy R.K., Prabhu J.C., Antia K.D., What will the future bring?

The influence of environmental forces and organizational characteristics on the decision to pursue lucrative strategic orientations is also examined. Using data collected from 316 bank branch managers, the authors find that market turbulence, intensity of competition, and decentralization in decision making play a pivotal role in determining managerial strategic priorities. Moreover, competitor orientation and innovation orientation contribute significantly to the development of marketing capabilities. In turn, marketing capabilities have a positive impact on firm performance. The authors discuss the managerial implications of study findings and offer directions for future research. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Frontline managers; Marketing capabilities; Performance; Strategic orientations","","Aiken M., Hage J., Organizational interdependence and intra-organizational structure, American Sociological Review, 33, 6, pp. 912-930, (1968); Anderson J.C., Gerbing D.W., Structural equation modeling in practice: A review and recommended two-step approach, Psychological Bulletin, 103, 3, pp. 411-423, (1988); Anderson C.R., Paine F.T., Managerial perceptions and strategic behavior, Academy of Management Journal, 18, 4, pp. 811-823, (1975); Armstrong J.S., Overton S.T., Estimating non-response bias in mail surveys, Journal of Marketing Research, 14, 3, pp. 396-402, (1977); Augusto M., Coelho F., Market orientation and new-to-the-world products: exploring the moderating effects of innovativeness, competitive strength, and environmental forces, Industrial Marketing Management, 38, 1, pp. 94-108, (2009); Auh S., Menguc B., Performance implications of the direct and moderating effects of centralization and formalization on customer orientation, Industrial Marketing Management, 36, 8, pp. 1022-1034, (2007); Bagozzi P.R., Yi Y., On the evaluation of structural equation models, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 16, 1, pp. 74-94, (1988); Barney J.B., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage, Journal of Management, 17, 1, pp. 99-120, (1991); Bentler P.M., EQS structural equations program manual, (1995); Bharadwaj S.G., Varadarajan P.R., Fahy J., Sustainable competitive advantage in service industries: A conceptual model and research propositions, Journal of Marketing, 57, pp. 83-99, (1993); Cadwallader S., Jarvis C.B., Bitner M.J., Ostrom A.L., Frontline employee motivation to participate in service innovation implementation, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 38, 2, pp. 219-239, (2010); Cano C.R., Carrillat F.A., Jaramillo F., A meta-analysis of the relationship between market orientation and business performance: Evidence from five continents, International Journal of Research in Marketing, 21, 2, pp. 179-200, (2004); Celuch K.G., Kasouf C.J., Peruvemba V., The effects of perceived market and learning orientation on assessed organizational capabilities, Industrial Marketing Management, 31, pp. 545-554, (2002); Cravens D.W., Ingram T.N., LaForge R.W., Young C.E., Behavior-based and outcome-based salesforce control systems, Journal of Marketing, 57, 4, pp. 47-59, (1993); Day G., The capabilities of market-driven organizations, Journal of Marketing, 58, 3, pp. 37-52, (1994); Day G.S., Nedungadi P., Managerial representations of competitive advantage, Journal of Marketing, 58, 2, pp. 31-44, (1994); Day G.S., Wensley R., Assessing advantage: A framework for diagnosing competitive superiority, Journal of Marketing, 52, pp. 1-20, (1988); DeSarbo W., Di Benedetto C.A., Song M., A heterogeneous resource based view for exploring relationships between firm performance and capabilities, Journal of Modeling in Management, 2, 2, pp. 103-130, (2007); Deshpande R., Farley J.U., Webster F.E., Corporate culture, customer orientation, and innovativeness in Japanese firms: A quadrad analysis, Journal of Marketing, 57, 1, pp. 23-27, (1993); Deshpande R., Zaltman G., Factors affecting the use of market research information: A path analysis, Journal of Marketing Research, 19, 2, pp. 14-31, (1982); Fornell C., Larcker D.F., Evaluating structural equation models with unobservable variables and measurement error, Journal of Marketing Research, 28, 1, pp. 39-50, (1981); Gao G.Y., Zhou K.Z., Yim C.K., On what should firms focus in transitional economies?

Design/methodology/approach: A questionnaire-based survey was conducted to gather data from food sector SMEs in the UK. The questionnaire design was informed by previous studies on degree and types of innovation, and the characteristics of innovativeness. Questionnaires were distributed and gathered by hand and online in order to optimise response. A total of 221 usable responses were received and analysed using SPSS. Findings: Food sector SMEs are more focused on incremental innovation as opposed to radical innovation, and they are also more engaged in product and process innovations than in packaging, position and paradigm innovations. In terms of innovation characteristics, SMEs agree that they are usually committed to the majority of a wide range of factors that affect innovation orientation, but most important amongst these are a commitment to encouraging new ideas, and cultivating innovative employees. Originality/value: Although the food and drink sector plays an important role within the UK economy, innovation in food sector SMEs has received little previous attention. This paper makes an important contribution by profiling innovation, according to type, and innovation characteristics in food sector SMEs in the UK. In addition, it demonstrates the importance of developing understanding of the management of innovation portfolios embracing a range of types and degrees of innovation. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Food and drink sector;

It extends current research by determining how specific transformational-leader behaviors influence the firm's innovation orientation and how national culture moderates this relationship. The study examines these behaviors empirically in 954 firms from eight countries. Findings reveal that six transformational-leader behaviors positively influence innovation orientation but with differing levels of intensity. Only two of these relationships, ""providing an appropriate model"" and ""accepting group goals,"" are culturally independent, while the other behaviors' effects tend to be culturally dependent. For example, ""providing intellectual stimulation"" has a stronger effect in collectivist cultures, cultures with high power distance, and low uncertainty-avoidance cultures than in other cultures. Similar culture-dependent findings emerge for other leader behaviors. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Innovation orientation; Leadership; National culture; Transformational leadership","","Amabile T.M., Motivating creativity in organizations: on doing what you love and loving what you do, California Management Review, 40, pp. 39-58, (1997);

The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of social media on hotels' business performance in the Lebanese hotel sector. In this study, a structural equation modelling method has been used for data analysis. The survey data was gathered from a sample of 146 hotels in Lebanon. Data analysis results demonstrate the positive and significant relationship between social media characteristics (visibility and association but not editability) on hotels' business performance. The findings present valuable implications for hotel managers to direct their social media strategy and to capitalize on the possible benefits of social media to increase the business performance of hotels. In addition, the findings could also provide useful insights into other business sectors that have an intention to invest in social media.

The principal aim of this paper is to provide empirical evidence on the direct effects of two specific strategic resources: Customer orientation and customer knowledge management (CKM), on innovation capacity and marketing results in SMEs. The study also examines the role of innovation orientation as a mediator between customer orientation and CKM. For this purpose, a structural model was proposed and tested through an empirical investigation with variance-based structural equation modeling (PLS) using a sample made up of 210 Spanish SMEs. The findings highlight the relevance of CKM and customer orientation as important strategic resources for developing innovation capacity and marketing results, and they confirm the mediation effect of innovation orientation. Empirical evidence supports the importance of customer orientation and CKM in boosting innovation and performance. These findings have important implications for performance in SMEs. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.","Customer knowledge management; customer orientation; innovation capacity; innovation orientation","","Abid M., Ali B., Antecedents and effectiveness of CKM: An empirical study, Middle-East Journal of Scientific Research, 19, 7, pp. 880-892, (2014); Alegre J., Kishor S., Lapiedra R., Knowledge management and the innovation performance in a high-tech SMEs industry, International Small Business Journal, 31, 4, pp. 454-470, (2013); Ambler T., Kokkinaki F., Puntoni S., Assessing marketing performance: Reasons for metrics selection, Journal of Marketing Management, 20, 3-4, pp. 475-498, (2004); Andreou A.N., Green A., Stankosky M., A framework of intangible valuation areas and antecedents, Journal of Intellectual Capital, 8, 1, pp. 52-75, (2007); Barney J.B., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage, Journal of Management, 17, 1, pp. 99-120, (1991); Barroso C., Cepeda G., Roldan J.L., Applying maximum likelihood and PLS on different sample sizes: Studies on SERVQUAL model and employee behaviour model, Handbook of Partial Least Squares: Concepts, pp. 427-447, (2010); Blazevic V., Lievens A., Managing innovation through customer coproduced knowledge in electronic services: An exploratory study, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 36, 1, pp. 138-151, (2008); Cantner U., Joel K., Schmidt T., The use of knowledge management by German innovators, Journal of Knowledge Management, 13, 4, pp. 187-203, (2009); Charan R., Tichy N.M., Every Business Is A Growth Business, (2000); Chen C.J., Huang J.W., Hsiao Y.C., Knowledge management and innovativeness: The role of organizational climate and structure, International Journal of Manpower, 31, 8, pp. 848-870, (2010); Chin W.W., The partial least squares approach to structural equation modelling, Modern Methods for Business Research, pp. 295-336, (1998); Mahwah N.J., How to write up and report PLS analyses, Handbook of Partial Least Squares, pp. 655-690, (2010); Chirico F., Knowledge accumulation in family firms.

It also aims at exploring the effects of soft and hard LM on innovation performance. Design/methodology/approach: The study analyzes survey data collected as a part of a high-performance manufacturing (HPM) project from 238 international manufacturing companies in eight countries and three industries. Exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were applied to assess construct validity. The study hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling. Findings: The results demonstrated that innovation-oriented companies tend to adopt aspects of both soft and hard LM. However, the results revealed an insignificant effect of soft and hard LM on innovation performance. The study also showed that innovation performance is positively influenced by an IO. These results indicate that having an IO is vital for enhancing both LM as well as innovation performance. They also evidently suggest that LM is more related to continuous improvement (incremental innovation) rather than (radical) innovation and, as such, is not important for firm’s intent on enhancing their innovation performance. Practical implications: The current study demonstrates that IO and LM are complementary and not contradicting strategies. The two strategies share many cultural aspects, similarities and commonalities. However, LM is not sufficient to predict innovation performance. Managers of the surveyed manufacturing firms are advised to focus on IO, as it has beneficial impacts on both LM (continuous improvement initiatives) as well as innovation performance. This clearly indicates that placing the emphasis upon radical (innovative) improvement rather than incremental improvement (LM practices) is believed to support continuous and innovative improvement alike. Originality/value: The relationship between LM and innovation is debated in the existing literature, but the debate is characterized by a lack of empirical evidence. This is one of the first studies that empirically investigates the relationships between IO, LM and innovation performance. It identifies some new insights to direct future research, particularly regarding different innovation types as well as in service organizations. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Hard lean; Innovation orientation; Innovation performance; International manufacturing companies; Lean management; Production and operations management; Soft lean","","Aalbers H.L., Dolfsma W., Bridging firm-internal boundaries for innovation: directed communication orientation and brokering roles, Journal of Engineering and Technology Management, 36, pp. 97-115, (2015); Abdallah A., Matsui Y., Just in time production and total productive maintenance: their relationship and impact on JIT and competitive performances, The 9th International Decision Sciences Institute Conference proceedings, pp. 1-10, (2007); Abdallah A., Matsui Y., The impact of lean practices on mass customization and competitive performance of mass-customizing plants, The 20th Annual Production and Operations Management Society (POMS) Conference proceedings, pp. 1-30, (2009); Abdallah A., Phan C.A., The relationship between just-in-time production and human resource management, and their impact on competitive performance, Yokohama Business Review, 28, 2, pp. 27-57, (2007); Abdallah A.B., The influence of “soft” and “hard” total quality management (TQM) practices on total productive maintenance (TPM) in Jordanian manufacturing companies, International Journal of Business and Management, 8, 21, pp. 1-13, (2013); Abdallah A.B., Abdullah M.I., Saleh F.I.M., The effect of trust with suppliers on hospital supply chain performance: the mediating role of supplier integration, Benchmarking: An International Journal, 24, 3, pp. 694-715, (2017); Abu Baker L., Ahmad H., Assessing the relationship between firm resources and product innovation performance: a resource-based view, Business Process Management Journal, 16, 3, pp. 420-435, (2010); Abu Nimeh H., Abdallah A.B., Sweis R., Lean supply chain management practices and performance: empirical evidence from manufacturing companies, International Journal of Supply Chain Management, 7, 1, pp. 1-15, (2018); Ahmad S., Schroeder R., Sinha K., The role of infrastructure practices in the effectiveness of JIT practices: implications for plant competitiveness, Journal of Engineering and Technology Management, 20, 3, pp. 161-191, (2003); Al-Sa'di A.F., Abdallah A.B., Dahiyat S.E., The mediating role of product and process innovations on the relationship between knowledge management and operational performance in manufacturing companies in Jordan, Business Process Management Journal, 23, 2, pp. 349-376, (2017); Al-Zu'bi Z.M.F., Tarawneh E., Abdallah A.B., Fidawi M., Investigating supply chain integration effects on environmental performance in the Jordanian food industry, American Journal of Operations Research, 5, 4, pp. 247-257, (2015); Amabile T.M., Motivating creativity in organizations: on doing what you love and loving what you do, California Management Review, 40, 1, pp. 39-58, (1997); Anderson J.C., Gerbing D.W., Structural equation modeling in practice: a review and recommended two-step approach, Psychological Bulletin, 103, 3, pp. 411-423, (1988); Awad H., Al-Zu'bi Z.M.F., Abdallah A.B., A quantitative analysis of the causes of drug shortages in Jordan: a supply chain perspective, International Business Research, 9, 6, pp. 53-63, (2016); Ayoub H.F., Abdallah A.B., Suifan T.S., The effect of supply chain integration on technical innovation in Jordan: the mediating role of knowledge management, Benchmarking: An International Journal, 24, 3, pp. 594-616, (2017); Benner M.J., Tushman M.L., Exploitation, exploration, and process management: the productivity dilemma revisited, Academy of Management Review, 28, 2, pp. 238-256, (2003); Benner M.J., Tushman M.L., Process management and technological innovation: a longitudinal study of photography and paint industries, Administrative Science Quarterly, 47, 4, pp. 676-706, (2002); Bollen K.A., Structural Equations with Latent Variables, (1989); Bortolotti T., Boscari S., Danese P., Successful lean implementation: organizational culture and soft lean practices, International Journal of Production Economics, 160, pp. 182-201, (2015); Bouncken R.B., The role of innovation orientation: strategic antecedents and innovation consequences of innovation orientation, International Journal of Technology Intelligence and Planning, 3, 3, pp. 213-232, (2007); Chen C.J., Huang Y.F., Creative workforce density, organizational slack, and innovation performance, Journal of Business Research, 63, 4, pp. 411-417, (2010); Chen H., Taylor R., Exploring the impact of lean management on innovation capability, Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology proceedings, pp. 826-834, (2009); Chiarini A., Vagnoni E., World-class manufacturing by fiat.

Drawing on the real options theory and the literature on exploration and exploitation, we develop a novel theoretical framework to assess the value of software patents. Moreover, we examine the impact of contextual factors related to the nature of innovation underlying firms’ patent portfolios (exploitative versus explorative) and the environmental uncertainty (competitiveness and dynamism) on the value of software patents. Specifically, we examine the interaction effect of a firm’s software patent stock and its innovation orientation on firm value in markets exhibiting different levels of environmental uncertainty. Based on a large-panel data set consisting of 602 U.S. firms, our results indicate that a software patent portfolio having higher levels of explorative orientation is associated with a higher firm value (as measured by Tobin’s q) in environments exhibiting low dynamism and high competitiveness. By contrast, a software patent portfolio with higher levels of exploitative orientation is associated with a higher firm value in environments with high dynamism and low competitiveness. We discuss the implications for research and practice.

Crucial to a more sustainable economy is the successful implementation of sustainable practices through entrepreneurial activities. Although there are attempts to describe how sustainable entrepreneurs differentiate themselves, the question of how some entrepreneurs manage to successfully create a sustainable enterprise, while others do not, remains unanswered. The aim of this research is to find causal patterns that explain the success of sustainable entrepreneurs, using their social performance as a measure. Using a configuration approach-based fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) of 598 Austrian small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), we could identify four different combinations of the interconnected variables of innovation orientation, environmental sustainability, resource leveraging and achievement motivation, which all lead to social performance depending on the respective networking intensity of the firms. The only variable that is included in all combinations is environmental sustainability, thus indicating it may be either crucial to or a prerequisite for achieving social performance in SMEs. © 2017 by the authors.","Achievement motivation; Configuration approach; Innovation; Networking; Resource leveraging; Social entrepreneurship; Social performance; Sustainability","Australia; comparative study; entrepreneur; fuzzy mathematics; innovation; networking; performance assessment; small and medium-sized enterprise; sustainability; sustainable development","Fellnhofer K., Kraus S., Bouncken R.B., The Current State of Research on Sustainable Entrepreneurship, Int.

The information collected for analysis came from a unique sample of 105 small farmers, who were settlers of an agrarian reform project in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. These farmers were granted similar resources (plot of land, housing, and capital) in the 1980s. About thirty years later, they were observed to have different performances in terms of production value. This article provides a test of explanatory variables for their differing performance, under the lens of strategic orientation. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) was used to obtain economic efficiency scores as proxies for performance. These scores were used in a second-stage Tobit regression model, in which the effects of three strategic orientations (profit orientation, social network orientation, and innovation orientation) on farms’ efficiency were tested. The results revealed that efficiency scores ranged from 0.02 and to 1, with a mean of 0.646 and standard deviation of 0.29, showing that the economic performance among beneficiaries is heterogeneous. In the Tobit model, the parameter for “profit orientation” was significant to explain performance differentials, while the parameters for the other strategic orientations were not. Parameters for control variables “off-farm income”, “access to rural credit”, and “access to government price policy” were also significant. These results are relevant to the theoretical debate on heterogeneity, as well as to the design of land reform policies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Heterogeneity; Land policy; Small farmers; Strategic orientation","Brazil; Sao Paulo [Brazil]; agrarian reform; development project; entrepreneur; government; heterogeneity; income; land reform; policy strategy; rural policy; smallholder","Abdallah A.H., Agricultural credit and technical efficiency in Ghana: is there a nexus?, Agric.

Many organizations at the front end of innovation struggle to engender an innovation approach that is effective and lasting. This article presents a framework that defines the interdependency of innovation and strategy, and then outlines the role of top management to continuously renew the positioning of the firm. Based on a synthesis of prior research—including the Dynamic Capabilities View, Innovation Orientation, and Disruptive Innovation Theory—and our own experience working with organizations, we present an operational strategy shift framework, which allows practitioners to increase, refine, and transform their firm's capability to innovate (CTI) toward achieving their strategic objectives. This framework provides guidance that leaders can use to integrate innovation into their strategic process. © 2018 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University","Corporate innovation; Corporate level strategy; Dynamic capabilities; Innovation capability; Innovation culture; Market disruption; Organizational practices; Strategic planning","","Assad V., Dobni C.B., Colby E., Ozyildirim A., (2017); Baker W.E., Sinkula J.M., Market orientation and the new product paradox, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 22, 6, pp. 483-502, (2005); Barney J., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage, Journal of Management, 17, 1, pp. 99-120, (1991); Berthon P., Hulbert J.M., Pitt L.F., Innovation or customer orientation?

Using a large multi-country sample, the analysis involved a structural equation model of seven organisational factors associated with the management of innovation, and their relationship with the anticipated volume of sales, profitability and lifecycle of the innovation. Significant relationships were found between the possession of an innovation strategy and formal commercialisation management, and optimism over sales volumes and lifecycle. The study provides new insights into the resource-based view and theory of entrepreneurial rents, strengthening SME owner-managers' assessment on future investments in innovation and how to utilise their best capabilities. Policy makers also gain more insights into the commercialisation process within SMEs to foster the innovation orientation in both high and low tech sectors. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.","Commercialisation; Innovation; Organisational factors; Rent; SMEs.","","Aarikka-Stenroos L., Sanberg B., Applying network approach to commercialisation of innovations: Case study on nets to create markets for innovations, IMP2009 Conference, pp. 1-21, (2009); Adams R., Bessant J., Phelps R., Innovation management measurement: A review, International Journal of Management Reviews, 8, 1, pp. 21-47, (2006); Al-Ansari Y., Xu J., Pervan S., A Study of Organisational Determinants and Innovation Practices in Dubai SMEs, International Journal of Innovation Management, 18, 1, pp. 1-28, (2014); Alegre J., Sengupta K., Lapiedra R., Knowledge management and innovation performance in a high-tech SMEs industry, International Small Business Journal, 31, 4, pp. 454-470, (2013); Alvarez S.A., Entrepreneurial rents and the theory of the firm, Journal of Business Venturing, 22, 3, pp. 427-442, (2007); Alvarez S.A., Barney J.B., How can entrepreneurial firms really benefit from alliances with large firmsffi, Academy of Management Executive, 15, 1, pp. 139-148, (2001); Alvarez S.A., Busenitz L.W., The entrepreneurship of resource-based theory, Journal of Management, 27, 12, pp. 755-775, (2001); Alvarez S.A., Barney J.B., Organizing rent generation and appropriation: Towards a theory of the entrepreneurial firm, Journal of Business Venturing, 19, 5, pp. 621-635, (2004); Amit R., Schoemaker P.J., Strategic assets and organisational rent, Strategic Management Journal, 14, 1, pp. 33-46, (1993); Andries P., Faems D., Patenting activities and firm performance: Does firm size matterffi, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 30, 6, pp. 1089-1098, (2013); Argote L., Ingram P., Knowledge transfer: A basis for competitive advantage in firms, Organisational Behaviour and Human Decision Processes, 82, 1, pp. 150-159, (2001); Athey S., Schmutzler A., Product and process flexibility in an innovative environment, The Rand Journal of Economics, 26, 4, pp. 557-574, (1995); Barney J.B., Organizational Culture: Can it be a source of sustained competitive advantageffi, Academy of Management Review, 11, 3, pp. 656-665, (1986); Barney J.B., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage, Journal of Management, 17, 1, pp. 99-120, (1991); Barney J.B., Is the resource-based view a useful perspective for strategic management researchffi, Yes.

The purpose of this paper is to revisit the concept innovation orientation in the light of recent research. Design/methodology/approach: This paper presents a systematic review of this literature, covering 74 scholarly articles published between 1982 and 2017. Findings: Innovation orientation is a sub-construct positioned within the wider field of innovation and relates to an innovation-based strategic orientation, where orientation is used to describe the overall dominant approach that represents an organisation’s competitive posture and strategic focus. It is a multifaceted construct that includes a range of core common variables innovation culture, competition-based understanding, organisational flexibility and specific capital and knowledge capabilities and is particular relevant for that managers and executives to understand how to manage innovation at the firm level. Literature also reports links between innovation orientation and organisational performance. Originality/value: On the basis of these analyses, a comprehensive innovation orientation framework is developed including key antecedents and key outcomes in terms of performance enhancement and capabilities development. Suggestions for future research are also presented. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Antecedents; Innovation orientation; Organizational capabilities; Performance measures","","Илякова И., Савина T., The scientific potential of innovative development of major domestic corporation: support, assessment, challenges, trends, National Interests Priorities & Security, 12, 7, pp. 131-143, (2016); Achtenhagen L., Melin L., Mullern T., Learning and continuous change in innovating organisations, Innovative Forms of Organising, pp. 72-94, (2003); Acikgoz A., Gunsel A., Individual creativity and team climate in software development projects: the mediating role of team decision processes, Creativity & Innovation Management, 25, 4, pp. 445-463, (2016); Altindag E., Zehir C., Back to the past: re-measuring the levels of strategic orientations and their effects on firm performance in Turkish family firms: an updated empirical study, Procedia – Social and Behavioral Sciences, 41, pp. 288-295, (2012); Amsteus M., Managers’ foresight matters, Foresight: The Journal for Future Studies, Strategic Thinking and Policy, 13, 2, pp. 64-78, (2011); Amsteus M., Subjective performance, managerial foresight, and objective performance, Strategic Change, 23, pp. 133-146, (2014); Appiah-Adu K., Singh S., Customer orientation and performance: a study of SMEs, Management Decision, 36, 5-6, pp. 385-395, (1998); Ayuso S., Rodriguez M.A., Garcia-Castro R., Arino M.A., Does stakeholder engagement promote sustainable innovation orientation?, Industrial Management & Data Systems, 111, 9, pp. 1399-1417, (2011); Baregheh A., Rowley J., Sambrook S., Davies D., Innovation in food sector SMEs, Journal of Small Business and Enterprise Development, 19, 2, pp. 300-321, (2012); Berthon P., Hulbert J.M., Pitt L.F., To serve or create?

Patents, trademarks, copyrights, and design rights are formal appropriation mechanisms. Secrecy, lead-time, and complexity are examples of informal appropriation mechanisms. Both external search breadth and depth are positively associated with firms’ use of informal appropriation mechanisms, while only external search breadth is positively associated with formal appropriation mechanisms. Firms’ degree of radical (incremental) innovation orientation is negatively (positively) associated with their use of formal appropriation mechanisms. Analysis of the joint impact of openness and innovativeness, suggests that for radical innovators it is external search breadth (rather than depth) that has a positive association with the use of informal appropriation mechanisms. In contrast, for radical innovators external search depth (rather than breadth) is associated with the use of formal appropriation mechanisms. For incremental innovators, external search breadth (rather than depth) is associated with the use of both formal and informal appropriation mechanisms. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Appropriation mechanisms; External search openness; Formal appropriation; Incremental innovators; Informal appropriation; Radical innovators","Engineering; External search openness; Formal appropriation; Incremental innovators; Informal appropriation; Radical innovators; Innovation","Alexy O., Criscuolo P., Salter A., Does IP strategy have to cripple open innovation?, MIT Sloan Manag.

The authors develop and test a theoretical model to predict first, how sustainable supply chain initiatives might influence reverse logistics outcomes and second, the impact of eco-reputation and eco-innovation orientation strategies on the deployment of sustainable supply chain initiatives. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – The proposed new model of antecedents and outcomes of sustainable supply chain initiatives underwent a rigorous empirical test through structural equation modeling with samples from an emerging market. Findings – The results show that firms that implement sustainable supply chain initiatives can realize positive reverse logistics outcomes; the study also provides new insights into eco-innovation and eco-reputation strategic orientations as theoretically important antecedents of sustainable supply chain initiatives. Research limitations/implications – Though the authors identify three components of sustainable supply chain initiatives, other components could exist, and ongoing research should investigate them. Practical implications – The findings have important implications for managers in emerging markets seeking to initiate ecologically friendly business practices. The authors offer strong evidence of the benefits obtained from reverse logistics in sustainable supply chain initiatives. Policy makers and firms attempting to nurture sustainable supply chain initiatives should not overlook the important role of eco-reputation and eco-innovation strategic orientations, which the results identify as important enablers. Originality/value – This study offers evidence of the critical role of eco-reputation and eco-innovation strategic orientations in deploying sustainable supply chain initiative programs, as well as of their mutual effects. This study also offers empirical evidence that implementing sustainable supply chain initiatives leads to reverse logistics, creating value, and a new source of competitive advantages. © 2016, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Eco-innovation;

This study aims to examine the curvilinear and interactive effects of brand orientation and innovation orientation on brand performance. Design/methodology/approach: Survey data were drawn from a sample of 181 firms operating in the consumer goods sector (i.e. fashion, consumer electronics and automobile) and tested through a hierarchical regression analysis. Findings: This study finds that the sole and exclusive focus on either brand orientation or innovation orientation is detrimental to the realisation of superior brand performance because increased levels of this focus lead to diminishing returns. Critically, this study finds that the key to achieving superior brand performance lies in the extent to which the firm integrates both brand orientation and innovation orientation. Originality/value: This study extends current knowledge by showing that focusing on either brand orientation or innovation orientation in isolation is actually detrimental to the firm’s realisation of superior brand performance. The integration of brand orientation and innovation orientation is the key to achieving superior brand performance because the inherent limitations associated with each are overcome by their integration. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Ambidexterity; Brand orientation; Brand performance; Curvilinear; Innovation orientation","","Aaker D.A., Managing Brand Equity, (1991); Aaker D.A., Building Strong Brands, (1996); Aiken L.S., West S.G., Multiple Regression Testing and Interpreting Interactions, (1991); Atuahene-Gima K., Resolving the capability-rigidity paradox in new product innovation, Journal of Marketing, 69, 4, pp. 61-83, (2005); Atuahene-Gima K., Murray J.Y., Exploratory and exploitative learning in new product development: a social capital perspective on new technology ventures in China, Journal of International Marketing, 15, 2, pp. 1-29, (2007); Atuahene-Gima K., Slater S., Olson E., The contingent value of responsive and proactive market orientations for new product program performance, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 22, 6, pp. 464-482, (2005); Barney J.B., How marketing scholars might help address issues in resource-based theory, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 42, 1, pp. 24-26, (2014); Baumgarth C., Living the brand: brand orientation in the business-to-business sector, European Journal of Marketing, 44, 5, pp. 653-671, (2010); Baumgarth C., Merrilees B., Urde M., Brand orientation: past, present, and future, Journal of Marketing Management, 29, 9-10, pp. 973-980, (2013); Baumgarth C., Schmidt M., How strong is the business-to-business brand in the workforce?

However, literature suffers from a lack of understanding of customer collaboration's role in the innovation process and innovation orientation in CKM. Accordingly, this paper tests a model examining how both variables act as antecedents of CKM. The model also explores CKM and customer collaboration's effect on marketing results. Findings have important academic and managerial implications, and show that collaboration with customers and openness to innovation are key inputs because of their effects on CKM and marketing results. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Customer collaboration; Customer knowledge management; Innovation orientation; Innovation process; Marketing results","","Alam I., An exploratory investigation of user involvement in new service development, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 30, 3, pp. 250-261, (2002); Alavi M., Leidner D., Knowledge management and knowledge management systems: Conceptual foundations and research issues, MIS Quarterly, 25, pp. 107-133, (2001); Alegre J., Sengupta K., Lapiedra R., Knowledge management and the innovation performance in a high-tech SMEs industry, International Small Business Journal, 31, 4, pp. 454-470, (2011); Bagozzi R., Yi Y., On the evaluation of structural equation models, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 16, 1, pp. 74-94, (1988); Ballantyne D., Varey R., Frow P., Payne A., Service-dominant logic and value propositions: Re-examining our mental models, Otago Forum 2 - Academic Papers, (2008); Cantner U., Joel K., Schmidt T., The use of knowledge management by German innovators, Journal of Knowledge Management, 13, 4, pp. 187-203, (2009); Chadam J., Pastuszak Z., Marketing aspects of knowledge-based management in groups of companies, case of Poland, Industrial Management & Data Systems, 105, 4, pp. 459-475, (2005); Eisenhardt K., Martin J., Dynamic capabilities: What are they?, Strategic Management Journal, 21, pp. 1105-1122, (2000); One trillion euro to invest in Europe's future - The EU's budget framework 2014-2020, (2013); Falk R., Miller N., A primer for soft modeling, (1992); Fang E., Palmatier R., Evans K., Influence of customer participation on creating and sharing of new product value, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 36, pp. 322-336, (2008); Fornell C., Larcker D., Evaluating structural equation models with unobservable variables and measurement error, Journal of Marketing Research, 18, 1, pp. 39-50, (1981); Huang P., Shih L., Effective environmental management through environmental knowledge management, International Journal of Environmental Science and Technology, 6, 1, pp. 35-50, (2009); Hurley R., Hult G.T., Innovation, market orientation and organization learning: An integration and empirical examination, Journal of Marketing, 62, 3, pp. 42-54, (1998); Lusch R., Vargo S., O'Brien M., Competing through service: Insights from service-dominant logic, Journal of Retailing, 83, 1, pp. 5-18, (2007); Massey A., Montoya-Weiss M., O'Driscoll T., Knowledge management in pursuit of performance: Insights from Nortel Networks, MIS Quarterly, 26, 3, pp. 269-289, (2002); Nesta L., Saviotti P., Coherence of the knowledge base and the firm's innovative performance: Evidence from the U.S. pharmaceutical industry, The Journal of Industrial Economics, 53, 1, pp. 123-142, (2005); Nonaka I., Takeuchi H., The knowledge-creating company: How Japanese companies create the dynamics of innovation, (1995); Ordanini A., Parasuraman A., Service innovation viewed through a service-dominant logic lens: A conceptual framework and empirical analysis, Journal of Services Research, 14, 1, pp. 3-23, (2011); Timely indicators of entrepreneurship.

Entrepreneurship is promoted as one of the most important approaches to achieving civilization and urbanization. However, few studies have systematically examined the influencing factors of landless peasants' entrepreneurial intention (EI). This research gap presents barriers for making effective policies to promote entrepreneurship among landless peasants. This study aims to examine the critical factors influencing the EI of landless peasants and their interrelationships. The critical factors of landless peasants' EI are identified using logistic regression analysis. The logical and structural relationships among critical factors are mined by interpretative structural modeling. A chain of factors with an interrelated and clear hierarchy is built to clarify the explanatory structure of landless peasants' EI. The results show that the EI of landless peasants is significantly influenced by five factors: gender, achievement motivation, innovation orientation, land expropriation scenario, and entrepreneurial experience. Entrepreneurial experience is a direct surface factor; innovation orientation is an indirect intermediate layer factor; and gender, achievement motivation, and land expropriation scenario are deeply rooted factors. The results provide a good reference for formulating effective entrepreneurship policies to address landless peasants' employment and sustainable livelihoods. © 2017 by the authors.","China; Entrepreneurial intention (EI); Interpretive structural modeling (ISM); Land expropriation scenario; Landless peasants","China; China; Yangtze River; agricultural worker; business development; civilization; employment generation; environmental factor; exploration; government; innovation; livelihood; peasant agriculture; social policy; sustainable development; urbanization","Hui E.C.M., Bao H., The logic behind conflicts in land acquisitions in contemporary China: A framework based upon game theory, Land Use Policy, 30, pp. 373-380, (2013); Lai Y., Peng Y., Li B., Lin Y., Industrial land development in urban villages in China: A property rights perspective, Habitat Int, 41, pp. 185-194, (2014); Lin S., Si S., Factors affecting peasant entrepreneurs' intention in the Chinese context, Int.

However, for many organizations today, it lacks tangibility as managers struggle with developing an innovation orientation that provides sustainable value creation. Using a mixed methods research approach, the aim and contribution of this paper is to report the qualitative findings of Fortune 1000 (F1000) organizations concerning their efforts to implement innovation agendas. Over 1100 business leaders were surveyed, which proves to be one of the largest surveys of innovation to date amongst the F1000. This article sets out to answer three basic questions as it concerns the implementation of an innovation agenda in organizations. These questions include: What does innovation mean to organizations? What has been the biggest challenges to introducing and sustaining an innovation orientation? And what has worked well in supporting an innovation orientation? What we have discovered is that leaders’ thoughts on innovation are anchored on the need for changing the status quo and trying something new. They are also particularly aware of the correlation between innovation and performance. The change theme is further echoed as the predominant barrier to change. That is, breaking the inertia of the status quo is seen as one of the top barriers to innovation. Further, our findings identified six common challenges to introducing, executing and sustaining innovation. These barriers revolve around resistance to change, organizational process, leadership, funding and resources, the external environment, and customer adoption. Finally, there are a cluster of activities that have worked well to support successful implementation of an innovation orientation in organizations. Important activities such as leadership for innovation, knowledge management, organizational structures and processes, and aligned performance management were identified by leaders as noteworthy to successful innovation. © 2015 Universidade do Porto - Faculdade de Engenharia.

The moderating effect of product life cycle (PLC) is also investigated. Using data collected from 204 manufacturers, we show that all three strategic orientations positively contribute to MC capability, both directly and indirectly through CKU. Further, our empirical findings suggest that the effects of customer, competitor and innovation orientation on MC capability are contingent on PLC. The effects of customer orientation on CKU and the effects of competitor orientation on CKU and MC capability are stronger when a product is in the maturity stage of its life cycle, whereas the effect of innovation orientation on CKU and MC capability are stronger in the growth stage. These findings suggest that to effectively improve MC capability, managers need to leverage external and internal orientations at different stages of the PLC. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","China; contingency effect; marketing operations management interface; mass customisation capability; product life cycle; strategic orientation","Sales; China; contingency effect; Marketing operations; Mass customisation; Product life cycles; Strategic orientation; Life cycle","Ahmad S., Schroeder R.G., Mallick D.N., The Relationship among Modularity, Functional Coordination, and Mass Customization: Implications for Competitiveness, European Journal of Innovation Management, 13, 1, pp. 46-61, (2010); Aitken J., Childerhouse P., Towill D., The Impact of Product Life Cycle on Supply Chain Strategy, International Journal of Production Economics, 85, 2, pp. 127-140, (2003); Alptekinoglu A., Corbett C.J., Mass Customization Vs.

This study aims to investigate the role of technology in service innovation based on a service innovation framework. After identifying four innovation orientations, we propose three competing models having different roles of technology (direct, indirect, and moderating). Using data from 193 service firms, we determine which model best explains the role of technology. Results show that technology plays multiple roles in service innovation. Our study helps managers effectively coordinate their technology infusion into service innovation to improve firm performance. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Complementarity theory; Resource-advantage theory; Service innovation; Strategic innovation orientation; Technology; Technology-push perspective","Information science; Information systems; Technology; Complementarity theory; Resource advantage; Service innovation; Strategic innovations; Technology pushes; Innovation","Armstrong J.S., Overton T.S., Estimating nonresponse bias in mail surveys, J.

However, empirical evidence as to how each orientation is shaped by environmental turbulence and whether it is fruitful to adopt both orientations simultaneously is lacking. This study attempts to close such an important research gap by surveying 294 managers at 147 firms in China. Results indicate that dysfunctional competition and technological turbulence, two critical environmental forces in emerging economies, influence the extent to which a firm adopts these two strategic orientations. The results also suggest that firms should stay focused on one strategic orientation rather than both to optimize their performance outcomes. © 2017 Product Development & Management Association","","Innovation; Management; Emerging economies; Environmental forces; Environmental turbulences; Performance outcome; Strategic orientation; Technological turbulences; Turbulence","Adner R., Levinthal D., Demand heterogeneity and technology evolution: Implications for product and process innovation, Management Science, 47, 5, pp. 611-628, (2001); Bagozzi R.P., Yi Y., Philips L.W., Assessing construct validity in organizational research, Administrative Science Quarterly, 36, 4, pp. 421-458, (1991); Bolton M.K., Imitation versus innovation: Lessons to be learned from the Japanese, Organizational Dynamics, 21, 3, pp. 30-45, (1993); Cao Q., Gedajlovic E., Zhang H., Unpacking organizational ambidexterity: Dimensions, contingencies, and synergistic effects, Organization Science, 20, 4, pp. 781-796, (2009); Churchill G.A.J., A paradigm for developing better measures of marketing constructs, Journal of Marketing Research, 16, February, pp. 67-73, (1979); Cui A.S., Griffith D.A., Cavusgil S.T., The influence of competitive intensity and market dynamism on knowledge management capabilities of multinational corporation subsidiaries, Journal of International Marketing, 13, 3, pp. 32-53, (2005); Daft R.L., Weick K.E., Towards a model of organizations as interpretation systems, Academy of Management Review, 9, April, pp. 284-295, (1984); DiMaggio P.J., Powell W.W., The iron cage revisited: Institutional isomorphism and collective rationality in organizational fields, America Sociological Review, 48, April, pp. 147-160, (1983); Drucker P.F., The discipline of innovation, Harvard Business Review, 80, August, pp. 95-102, (2002); Ethiraj S.K., Levinthal D., Roy R.R., The dual role of modularity: Innovation and imitation, Management Science, 54, 5, pp. 939-955, (2008); Fornell C., Bookstein F.L., Two structural equation models: LISREL and PLS applied to consumer exit-voice theory, Journal of Marketing Research, 19, November, pp. 440-452, (1982); Fornell C., Larcker D.F., Evaluating structural equation models with unobservable variables and measurement error, Journal of Marketing Research, 18, February, pp. 39-50, (1981); Gao G.Y., Zhou K.Z., Yim C.K.B., On what should firms focus in transitional economies?

These challenges are further amplified by the unstable and complex socio-cultural and socio-organizational characteristics of any developing economy. The paper explores and devises an adapted orientation for future innovation using a combined Delphi and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) approach, applied to a developing country, i.e. Thailand. A set of generic influencing factors for innovation management in public R&D, emerged from a non-country specific review, are refined by a three-round Delphi consultation involving experts from various Thai national research centers. These factors were further utilized to establish an AHP-based model applied to a Thai public R&D organization to investigate impacts of three hypothesized innovation orientations: ""knowledge"", ""societal"" and ""commercial"". The AHP-based model reveals that the ""commercial orientation"" has the highest impact score on innovation factors. However, a sensitivity analysis is conducted as a result of which a suggestion is made to increase the priority of collaboration-related factors to improve the impact of the ""societal orientation"". The findings from the combined Delphi and AHP approach have a generic dimension that can be adapted and tested in other contexts. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","AHP; Delphi; Innovation management; Public R&D","Thailand; Analytic hierarchy process; Developing countries; Innovation; Research; AHP; Analytic hierarchy; Analytic hierarchy process (ahp); Delphi; Developing economies; Future innovations; Innovation management; Planning innovations; analytical hierarchy process; Delphi analysis; innovation; research and development; sensitivity analysis; Hierarchical systems","Archibugi D., Filippetti A., Frenz M., Economic crisis and innovation: is destruction prevailing over accumulation?, Res.

In addition, it is analyzed if the age and size of the organization influence the relationship between learning and innovation. The empirical data were drawn from a sample of 253 companies in the industry, commerce and services sectors in Mexico, in the city of San Luis Potosí. A model of structural equations was estimated and the findings indicate that the learning orientation has a positive influence on performance and innovation orientation of the companies. It is also observed that the size of the company has a positive effect on innovation; however, no significant effect of the age of the organization on innovation is found. These conclusions contribute to increasing the evidence on the capabilities of smaller companies. © 2019 Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Facultad de Contaduría y Administración.","Firm performance; Innovation; Learning orientation","","Alegre J., Chiva R., Assessing the impact of organizational learning capability on product innovation performance: An empirical test, Technovation, 28, 6, pp. 315-326, (2008); Alegre J., Chiva R., Linking entrepreneurial orientation and firm performance: The role of organizational learning capability and innovation performance, Journal of Small Business Management, 51, 4, pp. 491-507, (2013); Baker W.E., Sinkula J.M., The synergistic effect of market orientation and learning orientation on organizational performance, Journal of The Academy of Marketing Science, 27, 4, pp. 411-427, (1999); Balasubramanian N., Lee J., Firm age and innovation, Industrial & Corporate Change, 17, 5, pp. 1019-1047, (2008); Barney J., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage, Journal of Management, 17, 1, pp. 99-120, (1991); Bianchini S., Krafft J., Quatraro F., Ravix J., Corporate governance, innovation and firm age: Insights and new evidence, GREDEG Working Papers Series, 68, 275, pp. 297-326, (2015); Cahill D., Lumpkin G.T., Dess G.G., Johnson P.C., Purser R.E., Montuori A., Abrahamson E., Dialogue / enriching the entrepreneurial orientation Construct—A reply to “Entrepreneurial orientation or pioneer advantage, Academy of Management Review, 21, 3, pp. 603-618, (1996); Calantone R.J., Cavusgil S.T., Zhao Y., Learning orientation, firm innovation capability, and firm performance, Industrial Marketing Management, 31, 6, pp. 515-524, (2002); Cavallo E., Powell E., La hora del crecimiento, Informe Macroeconómico De América Latina Y El Caribe, 2018, (2018); Ciriaci D., Moncada-Paterno-Castello P., Voigt P., Does Size or Age of Innovative Firms Affect Their Growth Persistence?

The strategic approach to the market realities, expressed through the specific needs of wine producers, retailers and customers in terms of permeability, neutrality and sustainability, is characterised by a deeply embedded integration and complementarity between the market and the innovation orientation of the firm. The capacity of the firm to develop and apply new technological improvements, supported by a strong policy of intellectual property protection, and an active strategy of marketing communications, represents an illustration of the successful application of various levers of managerial actions to enhance the performance and the market reputation of both the product offering and of the firm as a whole.

The model, anchored in decision theory and dynamic capabilities, is tested on a sample of Chinese exporting firms using structural equation modelling. Findings indicate that while a greater proclivity to innovate is beneficial for export market performance, a more complex web of relationships is revealed between the three export decision-making approaches and innovation orientation, providing insights on the operationalization of a dynamic decision-making capability. Specifically, while an increasing level of export planning reduces an exporter's capacity to innovate, creativity has a positive direct effect on exporters’ innovation orientation, which also benefits from extreme spontaneity in export decision-making. We discuss theoretical contributions and export managerial implications of this dynamic decision-making capability for industrial marketing management. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","China; Decision-making; Dynamic capabilities; Export market performance; Exporting; Innovation; Quadratic effects","","Amabile T.M., Conti R., Coon H., Lazenby J., Herron M., Assessing the work environment for creativity, Academy of Management Journal, 39, 5, pp. 1154-1184, (1996); Ansoff H.I., The firm of the future, Harvard Business Review, 43, 5, pp. 162-178, (1965); Antonakis J., Bendahan S., Jacquart P., Lalive R., On making causal claims: A review and recommendations, Leadership Quarterly, 21, 6, pp. 1086-1120, (2010); Auh S., Menguc B., Top management team diversity and innovativeness: The moderating role of interfunctional coordination, Industrial Marketing Management, 34, 3, pp. 249-261, (2005); Bailey A., Johnson G., Daniels K., Validation of a multi-dimensional measure of strategy development processes, British Journal of Management, 11, 2, pp. 151-162, (2000); Barnett M.L., An attention-based view of real options reasoning, Academy of Management Review, 33, 3, pp. 606-628, (2008); Barrett F.J., Coda-creativity and improvisation in jazz and organizations: Implications for organizational learning, Organization Science, 9, 5, pp. 605-622, (1998); Baum J.R., Wally S., Strategic decision speed and firm performance, Strategic Management Journal, 24, 11, pp. 1107-1129, (2003); Boso N., Story V.M., Cadogan J.W., Micevski M., Kadic-Maglajlic S., Firm innovativeness and export performance: Environmental, networking, and structural contingencies, Journal of International Marketing, 21, 4, pp. 62-87, (2013); Calantone R., Garcia R., Droge C., The effects of environmental turbulence on new product development strategy planning, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 20, 2, pp. 90-103, (2003); Camison C., Villar-Lopez A., Organizational innovation as an enabler of technological innovation capabilities and firm performance, Journal of Business Research, 67, 1, pp. 2891-2902, (2014); Chang Y.C., Chang H.T., Chi H.R., Chen M.H., Deng L.L., How do established firms improve radical innovation performance?

Box 173480, Bozeman, MT 59717-3480, United States","Like other developing countries, Pakistan is under severe economic pressure and striving to boost entrepreneurial orientation for achieving growth through minimal depletion of natural resources. In order to facilitate widespread and successful adoption of green entrepreneurial farming, it is crucial to address barriers inhibiting the uptake of green entrepreneurial activities in farming for the sustainability of natural resources as well as food provision. To this end, the present study aimed to investigate barriers in the adoption of green entrepreneurial farming in Pakistan. To fulfill the study objectives, after a comprehensive literature review and field visit, 34 barriers were identified. The results based on ranking analysis identified 20 out of 34 barriers as critical barriers to adoption of green entrepreneurial farming in the country. Furthermore, factor analysis was employed to group underlying 20 critical barriers into six major categories viz. 1) training and development-related barriers, 2) entrepreneurial orientation-related barriers, 3) market orientation-related barriers, 4) customer orientation-related barriers, 5) innovation orientation-related barriers, and 6) green supporting supplies-related barriers. Results showed that most dominant barrier among six groupings was training and development-related barriers and the marginal role of government in the provision of such endeavours. This implies that government needs to play a more active role in the adoption and promotion of green entrepreneurial farming in Punjab, Pakistan. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Customer orientation; Education orientation; Entrepreneurial orientation; Green entrepreneurship; Market orientation","Commerce; Developing countries; Barriers to adoption; Customer orientation; Economic pressures; Entrepreneurial activity; Entrepreneurial orientation; Green entrepreneurship; Market orientation; Training and development; Natural resources","Abdullah M., Zailani S., Iranmanesh M., Jayaraman K., Barriers to green innovation initiatives among manufacturers: the Malaysian case, Rev.

The purpose of this study is to identify the importance of teamwork culture for new product development (NPD) success through enriching the NPD team’s capability in Indian manufacturing industries. It accumulates the teamwork culture dynamics and practices, their interrelationships and their combined impact on NPD team’s capability in terms of technological developments for NPD success. This practical analysis collects primary data from 263 design and development experts from Indian engineering manufacturing companies. Structural equation modeling (SEM) approach is applied to investigate the interrelationship among associated variables of teamwork culture and NPD team’s capability for NPD success. Concurrent engineering team (CET), communication infrastructure (CI), system integration (SI) and result orientation (RO) have been recognized as allied factors of teamwork culture. Successful adoption of associated variables ensures NPD success through influencing NPD team’s capability which in turn articulated by technological developments. The realization of combined impact of teamwork and its allied variables escalates technological developments which in turn enriches NPD team’s capability assuring organizational success. The result indicates that both CI and SI support CET for accelerating NPD team’s capability through technological developments. Besides, CET motivates innovation orientation most precisely referred as RO for escalating NPD team’s capability through technological developments for innovation. © 2018 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.","Communication Infrastructure; Concurrent engineering team; New product development; NPD team’s capability; Structural equation modeling; System integration","","Anthony E.L., Green S.G., McComb S.A., Crossing functions above the cross-functional project team: The value of lateral coordination among functional department heads, Journal of Engineering and Technology Management, 31, pp. 141-158, (2014); Aronson Z.H., Reilly R.R., Lynn G.S., The impact of leader personality on new product development teamwork and performance: The moderating role of uncertainty, Journal of Engineering and Technology Management, 23, 3, pp. 221-247, (2006); Atuahene-Gima K., Slater S.F., Olson E.M., The contingent value of responsive and proactive market orientations for new product program performance, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 22, 6, pp. 464-482, (2005); Augusto M., Coelho F., Market orientation and new-to-the-world products: Exploring the moderating effects of innovativeness, competitive strength, and environmental forces, Industrial Marketing Management, 38, 1, pp. 94-108, (2009); Azad N., Aliakbar S., Zarifi S., Hozouri S., Investigating product development strategy in beverage industry using factor analysis, Management Science Letters, 3, 3, pp. 897-902, (2013); Bain P.G., Mann L., Pirola-Merlo A., The innovation imperative: The relationships between team climate, innovation, and performance in research and development teams, Small Group Research, 32, 1, pp. 55-73, (2001); Benoliel P., Somech A., The role of leader boundary activities in enhancing interdisciplinary team effectiveness, Small Group Research, 46, 1, pp. 83-124, (2015); Bentler P.M., Comparative fit indexes in structural models, Psychological Bulletin, 107, 2, (1990); Berthon P., Hulbert J., Pitt L., Innovation or customer orientation?

Although recent research emphasises the influence of resource scarcity on SME innovation orientation, we argue that no clear hypothesis can be made about this relationship; rather, we focus on the role of managers and owners in influencing innovation orientation. We find that resource scarcity is not correlated with the innovation orientation of SMEs, while the growth ambitions of managers and owners strongly and positively influence their focus on both exploratory and exploitative innovation. Contrary to our expectations, we find that managerial perception of competitive intensity only moderately influences innovation orientation, while managerial perception of market growth does not influence innovation orientation. Our findings suggest that achieving ambidexterity is primarily a matter of ambition and entrepreneurial capability, rather than an issue of having the necessary resources or lucrative market conditions to innovate ambidextrously. As we also find that ambidextrous SMEs have the strongest innovation performance, our findings indicate that SMEs both can and should be ambidextrous. © The Author(s) 2019.","competitive intensity; dynamic capabilities;

The concept of Ego Development has been often employed for the examination of these phenomena. At the same time, further research is needed in regard to women entrepreneurs in particular and national economic contexts. The complexity of the examined theoretical constructs does not allow for straightforward predictions in this direction. The current paper contributes to the outlined field with the examination of innovation orientation with reference to ego development of female business owners in Germany and Ireland. Using a sample for the target population in these two countries, we apply descriptive statistics, Chi- Square and Correlation analysis to examine multiple statistical relations between the target variables. Among others, we deliver the following key findings. The majority of the studied women entrepreneurs show the advanced levels of Ego Development, reaching its E5 (Self-Awareness) and E6 (Consciousness) stages. We also discover the national differences with this respect, showing higher development level for Irish participants than for German ones, also exceeding the managers’ level in the prominent literature to the topic. Similarly, the operationalization of innovation orientation through entrepreneurial orientation related to new ways of acting and solutions, as well as in the encouragement of other persons, is more strongly marked in Ireland than in Germany. In both countries, the support for this orientation is positively associated with the higher levels of Ego Development, namely Self-Awareness and Consciousness. The national differences are also reflected in the placement of the German sample on E5 (Self Awareness) level and the Irish one on E6 (Consciousness) stage. Additionally, we find the weak statistically significant correlation between the dimension and indicator of the discussed phenomenon in both countries. Nevertheless, when applying a comparative country-specific perspective, the conclusion upon the dimension and both indicators remains valid for Germany only. We have addressed the number of limitations and precautions when extrapolating the findings for the similar populations. The related socio-economic studies have been presented for the interpretation and application of the discovered psychological patterns. © 2019, Allied Business Academies.

Drawing on the earlier research and scales in the entrepreneurial orientation, market orientation, innovation orientation and customer orientation literatures, the article proposes a conceptual model for entrepreneurial marketing that identifies the components of such a model, together with specific indications of the overlap between scales in the different areas. This model implicitly suggests that marketing in SMEs is intertwined with other activities and behaviours in the small business enterprise, and argues that in order to understand marketing in SMEs it is essential to understand its context, specifically in relation to customer engagement, innovation and entrepreneurial approaches to marketing. © The Author(s) 2010.","customer orientation;

In the hospitality context, there is little research on innovation. The purpose of this study is to understand how innovation and customer-oriented value systems can affect performance in the context of the hospitality industry. Design/methodology/approach: A comprehensive literature review is conducted to identify the major indices of innovation in the context of the hospitality industry. A self-administered questionnaire survey was used, and the target population included the managers and employees who work in the 3- and 4-star hotels of Isfahan. The sample size was 226. A convenience sampling approach was used to collect the required sample. Findings: The results of structural equation modelling indicated that customer orientation and innovativeness orientation have a significant influence on hotel performance. Furthermore, customer orientation influenced the innovativeness orientation of hotel employees. Originality/value: This paper provides a valuable insight into the measurement of innovation, customer orientation and performance in the hospitality industry and offers a foundation for future hospitality innovation research. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Customer orientation;

It develops a comparatively simple organisational cultural model based on four work practices: support orientation, innovation orientation, co-ordination orientation, and rules orientation. For validation, it was operationalised into a 21 item survey questionnaire that mainly used a Likert scale from ""strongly agree"" to ""strongly disagree."" This paper presents the validity and reliability of the items with Cronbach alpha values of between 0.8 and 0.9. Both positive and negative values like trust, honesty, and selfishness affect work practices which are presented as good reflections and measures of organisational culture. The four work practices are reliable and valid reflections of organisational culture. Though not yet extensively tested, the model can be used by IT professionals for assessing IT projects from organisational culture perspective. It also constitutes a useful platform for other research, e.g., effect of organisational culture on knowledge sharing.

However, companies usually face resource constraints and therefore must strive to identify and combine the most important drivers of superior innovativeness effectively. This research addresses this practical challenge by identifying typical patterns of innovation orientation and their associated performance outcomes. Drawing on configuration and boundary theory, the authors develop a framework and hypotheses, then use data from marketing managers, R&D managers, and customers to identify four patterns: integrated innovators, internally driven preservers, proactive customer-oriented innovators, and top-down innovators. The empirical results reveal performance differences across these patterns. An integrated approach leads to the highest innovativeness scores, but proactive customer-oriented innovators and top-down innovators enjoy the greatest financial success. © 2010 Academy of Marketing Science.","Boundary theory;

Using panel data of 3,201 Spanish firms for the period 2008–14, we specify a dynamic random probit model controlling for sample selection. The empirical results confirm that public regulations and R&D efforts encourage firms to place eco-innovation activities among their strategic priorities, although subsidies are not found to be a distinctive driver. Furthermore, we find that eco-innovation is highly persistent at the firm level, past eco-innovation behavior being clearly of key importance in explaining the current state of a firm's eco-innovation orientation. In contrast, market factors are not found to be a key driver for eco-innovative firms.

Thus, this study uses a sample of 542 manufacturing firms in Korea to examine how innovation orientation and firm size and age as internal characteristics influence the relationship between collaboration with research organizations and innovation performance. The results show that collaboration with research organizations has a positive impact on innovation performance. More importantly, this effect is stronger (weaker) for firms with a strong orientation toward exploration (exploitation). In addition, older or larger firms obtain greater benefits from collaboration with research organizations. This study contributes toward clarifying a firm’s collaboration with research organizations. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Collaboration; Exploitation and exploration; Innovation performance; Moderating effect; Research organization","Industrial research; Societies and institutions; Collaboration; Exploitation and explorations; Innovation performance; Moderating effect; Research organization; Innovation","Acs Z.J., Audretsch D.B., Patents as a measure of innovative activity, Kyklos, 42, 2, pp. 171-180, (1989); Amir R., Evstigneev I., Wooders J., Noncooperative versus cooperative R&D with endogenous spillover rates, Games and Economic Behavior, 42, 2, pp. 183-207, (2003); Aristei D., Vecchi M., Venturini F., University and inter-firm R&D collaborations: Propensity and intensity of cooperation in Europe, The Journal of Technology Transfer, 2, pp. 1-31, (2015); Baum J.A.C., Calabrese T., Silverman B.S., Don’t go it alone: Alliance network composition and startups’ performance in Canadian biotechnology, Strategic Management Journal, 21, 3, pp. 267-294, (2000); Beckman C.M., Haunschild P.R., Phillips D.J., Friends or strangers?

Data were collected from high-star hospitalities. Through the issuance and the collection of questionnaires, the scale is verified to have good reliability and validity by SPSS software analysis. Meanwhile, the structural equation model (SEM) is suited for testing structural dimensions of service employees' innovation behavior. The results showed that service employees' innovation behavior could be decomposed into a four-dimensional structure, namely innovation orientation, ideas generation, innovation implementation and innovation practice. In addition, there are significant differences in service employees' innovation behavior about subjects' gender, position, education background and years of working.

The study finds that several endogenous factors, including tangibility of sector, firm size, innovative orientation, family influence and perceived financial benefits from energy conservation, predict an SME's level of engagement in selected environmental management practices. For family influence, this effect is found only in interaction with the number of owners.

However, many real estate developers in China are less willing to develop GRBs, because of the factors affecting green residential building development (GRBD). In order to promote the sustainable development of GRBs in China, this paper, based on the perspective of real estate developers, identifies the influential and critical factors affecting GRBD, using the method of social network analysis (SNA). Firstly, 14 factors affecting GRBD are determined from 64 preliminary factors of three main elements, and the framework is established. Secondly, the relationships between the 14 factors are analyzed by SNA. Finally, four critical factors for GRBD, which are on the local economy development level, development strategy and innovation orientation, developer's acknowledgement and positioning for GRBD, and experience and ability for GRBD, are identified by the social network centrality test. The findings illustrate the key issues that affect the development of GRBs, and provide references for policy making by the government and strategy formulation by real estate developers. © 2018 by the author.","Critical factors; Development strategy; Green residential building; Influential factors; Social network analysis","China; building; critical analysis; development strategy; energy efficiency; environmental factor; greenspace; innovation; local economy; network analysis; policy making; social network; sustainable development; urban development","Research Report on Building Energy Consumption in China, (2017); Mills E., Building commissioning: A golden opportunity for reducing energy costs and greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, Energy Effic, 4, pp. 145-173, (2011); Zhao H.X., Magoules F., A review on the prediction of building energy consumption, Renew.

Why do some firms benefit more than others from openness? A firm's strategy, which includes market and innovation orientation as well as internal structures and processes, is likely to be indicative of an adequate degree of firm openness and a well-considered selection of open innovation approaches. By analyzing 25 firms according to three proactive strategy archetypes of innovation management, we identified distinctive behaviours regarding open and closed innovation activities. The three archetypes present an adequate degree of openness, adjusted to each archetype's strategic characteristics. Innovation managers can learn from this study how to skilfully link innovation models with each other as well as which degree of firm openness may be beneficial in order to reach a desired level of innovation performance. Furthermore, they can understand which open innovation activities are characteristic of a specific proactive strategy archetype of innovation management.

The hypothesized model of innovation orientation consists of creativity, innovation motivation, entrepreneurial orientation and entrepreneurial self-efficacy constructs. These five constructs was established employing comprehensive literature reviews. 24 items was adapted and three rounds of Delphi study were conducted to validate them. Participants were 20 Malaysian higher education institutions’ academicians. The initial 24 items to measure the five constructs went through refinement and contextualization to conceive innovation orientation for undergraduates’ survey. Consensus achieved after three rounds of Delphi study. The qualitative comments written by the participants was collected, coded and changes made were translated into the 24 items until the quantitative result for all items received moderate and high level of agreement. © 2015, Canadian Center of Science and Education.

These competencies are at the core of innovation in a service firm such as a hotel or a restaurant franchise. An innovation-oriented service franchise knows how to listen to its employees and customers; however, choosing which customer or employee to listen to might be paramount to finding radical innovative ideas. Learning from the past, this article investigates sources of innovation in the hospitality industry and tests the lead-user method borrowed from the manufacturing industry to extract innovative service ideas from the market before they materialize as competing market offerings. Using a downtown hotel as an empirical example, this study shows that not only are innovative service ideas present in the marketplace, but also that the best ideas most likely exist within the minds of current and past dissatisfied clients, the latter of which is often referred to as ""service defectors."" © 2012 International Council on Hotel, Restaurant and Institutional Education.","defectors; innovation orientation; innovative users; service innovation","","Adamy J., Tall order for Starbucks: Investors seek reassurance on brand's buzz as competition circles, The Wall Street Journal, (2007); A Century of Hospitality 1910-2010, (2009); Amabile T.M., Children's artistic creativity: Detrimental effects of competition in a field setting, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 8, pp. 573-578, (1982); Amabile T.M., Creativity in Context, (1996); Armstrong J.S., Overton T.S., Estimating nonresponse bias in mail surveys, Journal of Marketing Research, 14, pp. 396-402, (1977); Bansal H.S., Irving P.G., Taylor S.F., A three-component model of customer commitment to service-providers, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 32, pp. 234-250, (2004); Bansal H.S., Taylor S.F., St. James Y., Migrating to new service-providers: Towards a unifying framework of consumers' switching behaviors, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 33, pp. 96-115, (2005); Berry L.L., Shankar V., Parish J.T., Cadwallader S., Dotzel T., Creating new markets through service innovation, MIT Sloan Management Review, 47, pp. 56-63, (2006); Bolton R.N., Drew J.H., Longitudinal analysis of the impact of service changes on customer attitudes, Journal of Marketing, 55, 1, pp. 1-9, (1991); Boulding W., Staelin R., Zeithaml V., Kalra A., A dynamic process model of service quality: From expectations to behavioral intentions, Journal of Marketing Research, 30, pp. 7-27, (1993); Burnham T.A., Frels J.K., Mahajan V., Consumer switching costs: A typology, antecedents, and consequences, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 31, pp. 109-126, (2003); Capraro A.J., Broniarczyk S., Srivastava R.K., Factors influencing the likelihood of customer defection: The role of consumer knowledge, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 31, pp. 164-175, (2003); Chebat J.-C., Davidow M., Codjovi I., Silent voices: Why some dissatisfied consumers fail to complain, Journal of Service Research, 7, pp. 328-342, (2005); Cronin J.J., Brady M.K., Hult G.T.

While ambidexterity-oriented decisions embrace the capability of top management teams to manage contradictory strategic directions, namely adaptability and alignment, innovative ambidexterity captures the ability of firms to simultaneously develop discontinuous and incremental innovations. In addition to the direct relationship between ambidexterity-oriented decisions and innovative ambidexterity, it is argued that innovation orientation and cost orientation denote two cultural implementation mechanisms that mediate this effect. Using two top-executive data sets collected in the United States (n = 83) and India (n = 78), the empirical analysis shows that innovation orientation and cost orientation partially mediate the direct influence of ambidexterity-oriented decisions on innovative ambidexterity, thus further explaining how formulated decisions made by the top management team nurture ambidextrous innovation behavior. Hence, this article extends prior literature that emphasizes a positive influence of top managers on innovation through incorporating an organizational ambidexterity perspective. Second, this study contributes to ambidexterity literature through integrating strategic process theory. While ambidexterity-oriented decisions primarily relate to strategy formulation, innovation orientation and cost orientation are associated with strategy implementation. The results show that both strategic subprocesses are vital in enabling ambidextrous innovation behavior. Third, an operationalization for the ability of top management to balance adaptability- and alignment-oriented decisions is provided based on prior literature. © 2014 Product Development & Management Association.","","Cost benefit analysis;

The questionnaire survey conducted among 220 manufacturing exporters reveals that there exist positive relationships among the constructs in question. This research departs from the majority of past research investigating the relationship among market orientation, product innovation and business performance in three aspects: (1) it examines the impact mechanism how market orientation improves new product performance and export performance through innovation orientation and innovation resources based on RBV, (2) it distinguishes among three constructs involved in product innovation activity, and (3) it extends the research from domestic markets to export markets. We conclude by discussing our contributions, the implications, and possible future extensions. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","export performance; innovation orientation; innovation resources; market orientation; product innovation performance","","Akgun A.E., Keskin H., Byrne J.C., Aren S., Emotional and learning capability and their impact on product innovativeness and firm performance, Technovation, 27, pp. 501-513, (2007); Akman G., Yilmaz C., Innovative capability, innovation strategy and market orientation: An empirical analysis in Turkish software industry, International Journal of Innovation Management, 12, pp. 69-111, (2008); Akyol A., Akehurst G., An investigation of export performance variations related to corporate export market orientation, European Business Review, 15, pp. 5-19, (2003); Atuahene-Gima K., Slater S.F., Olson E.M., The contingent value of responsive and proactive market orientations for new product program performance, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 22, pp. 464-482, (2005); Auh S., Menguc B., Top management team diversity and innovativeness: The moderating role of interfunctional coordination, Industrial Marketing Management, 34, pp. 249-261, (2005); Baker W.E., Sinkula J.M., The synergistic effect of market orientation and learning orientation on organizational performance, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 27, pp. 411-427, (1999); Baker W.E., Sinkula J.M., Market orientation, learning orientation and product innovation: Delving into the organization's black box, Journal of Market-Focused Management, 5, pp. 5-23, (2002); Baker W.E., Sinkula J.M., Market orientation and the new product paradox, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 22, pp. 483-502, (2005); Balas A.N., Colakoglu S.N., Gokus O., Examining the relationship between the three components of market orientation and innovativeness in export ventures, International Journal of Entrepreneurship, 16, 1, pp. 1-17, (2012); Boso N., Cadogan J.W., Story V.M., Complementary effect of entrepreneurial and market orientations on export new product success under differing levels of competitive intensity and financial capital, International Business Review, 21, pp. 667-681, (2012); Bozic L., The effects of market orientation on product innovation, Economic Trends and Economic Policy, 16, pp. 46-65, (2006); Burgelman R., Christensen C., Wheelwright S.C., Maidique M.A., Strategic management of technology and innovation, (2004); Cadogan J.W., Diamantopoulos A., De Mortanges C.P., A measure of export market orientation: Scale development and cross-cultural validation, Journal of International Business Studies, 30, pp. 689-707, (1999); Cadogan J.W., Kuivalainen O., Sundqvist S., Export market-oriented behavior and export performance: Quadratic and moderating effects under differing degrees of market dynamism and internationalization, Journal of International Marketing, 17, pp. 71-89, (2009); Calantone R.J., Cavusgil S.T., Zhao Y., Learning orientation, firm innovation capability, and firm performance, Industrial Marketing Management, 31, pp. 515-524, (2002); Child J., Tse D.K., China's transition and its implications for international business, Journal of International Business Studies, 32, pp. 5-21, (2001); Christensen C.M., Bower J.L., Customer power, strategic investment, and the failure of leading firms, Strategic Management Journal, 17, pp. 197-218, (1996); Churchill G.A., A paradigm for developing better measures of marketing constructs, Journal of Marketing Research, 16, pp. 64-73, (1979); Cooper R.G., Kleinschmidt E.J., New products: What separates winners from losers?, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 4, pp. 90-111, (1987); Cooper R.G., Edgett S., Kleinschmidt E.J., Benchmarking best NPD practice, Research Technology Management, 4, pp. 50-59, (2004); Damanpour F., Organizational innovation: A meta-analysis of effects of determinants and moderators, Academy of Management Journal, 34, pp. 555-590, (1991); Day G.S., The capabilities of market-driven organizations, Journal of Marketing, 58, pp. 37-52, (1994); Deng Z., Lu Y., Wei K.K., Zhang J., Understanding customer satisfaction and loyalty: An empirical study of mobile instant messages in China, International Journal of Information Management, 30, pp. 289-300, (2010); Deshpande R., Farley J., Webster F., Corporate culture, customer orientation, and innovation orientation in Japanese firms: A quadrad analysis, Journal of Marketing, 57, pp. 23-38, (1993); Diamantopoulos A., Siguaw J.A., Cadogan J.W., Export performance: The impact of cross-country export market orientation, Marketing theory and application.

This is particularly the case for supplier innovations, as new product concepts and strategies must cope with supply chain interfaces. Suppliers' strategies are oftentimes confronted by innovation rigidities resulting from a manufacturers' need to manage the integration of several components from various suppliers into a coherent innovation. Suppliers can follow different innovation strategies derived from a deliberate planning or a emerging as suppliers incrementally learn and experiment along their path. A survey of 241 suppliers illustrates that these two strategic types effect on market success depends on the level of the rigidities. The survey results also illustrate that two dynamic capabilities, the planning capability and the innovation orientation, act as intermediary variables to increase success under specific rigidity conditions. The findings further illustrate that dynamic capabilities can be enhanced by an adequate strategy. © 2011 Imperial College Press.","Dynamic capabilities; Innovation culture; Innovation strategy; Supply chain","","Alegre-Vidal J., Lapiedra-Alcami R., Chiva-Gomez R., Linking operations strategy and product innovation: An empirical study of Spanish ceramic tile producers, Research Policy, 33, 5, pp. 829-839, (2004); Ansoff H.I., Critique of Mintzberg, Henry the design school - Reconsidering the basic premises of strategic management, Strategic Management Journal, 12, 6, pp. 449-461, (1991); Bagozzi R.P., Yi Y., On the evaluation of structural equation models, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 16, 1, pp. 74-94, (1988); Baker T., Miner A.S., Eesley D.T., Improvising firms: Bricolage, account giving and improvisational competencies in the founding process, Research Policy, 32, 2, pp. 255-276, (2003); Baker W.E., Sinkula J.M., The synergistic effect of market orientation and learning orientation on organizational performance, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 27, 4, pp. 411-427, (1999); Balachandra R., Friar J.H., Factors for success in r&d projects and new product innovation: A contextual framework, IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, 44, 3, pp. 276-287, (1997); Bouncken R.B., Koch M., Teichert T., Innovation strategy explored: Innovation orientation's strategy preconditions and market performance outcomes, Zeitschrift f€ur Betriebswirtschaft, 2, (2007); Brews P.J., Hunt M.R., Learning to plan and planning to learn: Resolving the planning school/learning school debate, Strategic Management Journal, 20, 10, pp. 889-913, (1999); Brown S.L., Eisenhardt K.M., Product development: Past research, present findings, and future directions, Academy of Management Review, 20, 2, pp. 343-378, (1995); Brown S.L., Eisenhardt K.M., The art of continuous change: Linking complexity theory and time-paced evolution in relentlessly shifting organizations, Administrative Science Quarterly, 42, 1, pp. 1-34, (1997); Browne M., Cudeck R., Alternative ways of assessing model fit, Testing Structural Equation Models, pp. 136-162, (1993); Byrne B.M., Structural Equation Modeling with AMOS - Basic Concepts, Applications, and Programming, (2001); Byrne B.M., Testing for multigroup invariance using AMOS graphics: A road less traveled, Structural Equation Modeling, 11, 2, pp. 272-300, (2004); Cohen K.J., Cyert R.M., Strategy - Formulation, implementation, and monitoring, Journal of Business, 46, 3, pp. 349-367, (1973); Cooper R.G., New product strategies: What distinguishes the top performers?, Journal Product Innovation Management, 1, 3, pp. 151-164, (1984); Cooper R.G., Kleinschmidt E.J., Benchmarking the firm's critical success factors in new product development, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 12, pp. 374-391, (1995); De Sarbo W.S., Di Benedetto C.A., Song M., Sinha I., Revisiting the miles and snow strategic framework: Uncovering interrelationships between strategy types, capabilities, environmental uncertainty, and firm performance, Strategic Management Journal, 27, 3, pp. 467-488, (2005); Dyer B., Song X.M., Innovation Strategy and Sanctioned Conflict: A New Edge in Innovation?, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 15, 6, pp. 505-519, (1998); Fredrickson J.W., The comprehensiveness of strategic decision-processes - Extension, observations, future-directions, Academy of Management Journal, 27, 3, pp. 445-466, (1984); Fredrickson J.W., Iaquinto A.L., Inertia and creeping rationality in strategic decision-processes, Academy of Management Journal, 32, 3, pp. 516-542, (1989); Griffin A., PDMA research on new product development practices: Updating trends and benchmarking best practices, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 14, 6, pp. 429-458, (1997); Guerard J.B., Bean A.S., Stone B.K., Goal-setting for effective corporate-planning, Management Science, 36, 3, pp. 359-367, (1990); Henderson R., Clark K., Architectural innovation: The reconfiguration of existing product technologies and the failure of existing firms, Administrative Science Quarterly, 35, pp. 9-30, (1990); Idenburg P.J., Four styles of strategy-development, Long Range Planning, 26, 6, pp. 132-137, (1993); Joreskog K.G., Aish A.M., Structural modeling by example - Applications in educational, sociological, and behavioral-research - Cuttance, P, Ecob, R, Contemporary Psychology, 35, 7, pp. 687-688, (1990); Kamoche K., Cinha M.P.E., Minimal structures: From Jazz improvisation to product innovation, Organization Studies, 22, 5, pp. 733-764, (2001); Kohli A.K., Jaworski B., Market orientation: The construct, research propositions, and managerial implications, Journal of Marketing, 54, pp. 1-18, (1990); Le Blanc G., Nguyen N., Cues used by customers evaluating corporate image in service firms.

The manufacturing strategy is posited to be influenced by customer orientation, competitor orientation, resource orientation, and innovation orientation. The findings of this study are based on a sample of the top management of 194 manufacturing concerns from the Canadian technology sector. The analysis using structural equal modelling informs that customer orientation impacts quality and flexibility strategies while competitor orientation influences cost and delivery strategies. Innovation strategy is impacted by innovation orientation. Resource orientation did not significantly impact manufacturing strategy. Quality strategy has the strongest influence on manufacturing capability, followed by cost, innovation and flexibility strategies. Manufacturing capability, in turn, influences both financial and non-financial performance.

We applied theory on dual allegiance to multiple targets of commitment, in conjunction with person-organization fit theory, to explore the dynamics of organizational and professional commitment among scientists and engineers working in hybrid, research-focused organizations. These types of organizations are founded on large-scale multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional collaboration between academe and industry. Using both individual- and organizational-level variables collected from 255 academic science and engineering researchers working in 22 National Science Foundation-funded Engineering Research Centers, our analyses revealed that researcher innovation orientation (i.e., the predisposition to approach work in novel ways) was positively associated with organizational and professional commitment. Those relationships were moderated by two factors: organizational productivity in late-stage technology transfer and the researcher's perceived role significance (i.e., in fulfilling the strategic mission of the organization). The strongest positive relationship between innovation orientation and organizational commitment emerged among researchers who perceived high role significance and worked in highly productive organizations. A negative relationship between innovation orientation and professional commitment also emerged among those individuals. Post-hoc analyses revealed that highly innovative, senior researchers who perceived high role significance were the most likely to report higher levels of both organizational and professional commitment.

It addresses the apparent tension between quality management and innovation management and seeks empirical support for the proposition that qualitymanagement resources can be used to support strategic innovation. Based on resource-based view, it defines key resources that firms develop during implementation of TQMsystems: TQM culture, product design capability, and process improvement capability-and assesses the role of these resources in the success of product innovation. Design/methodology/approach-A survey of 112 manufacturing firms was conducted and the resulting data were analyzed using partial least squares (PLS) to determine how TQM constructs affect strategic product innovation. Findings-The main finding suggests that only product design capability contributes to strategic product innovation. TQM culture has a direct influence on process improvement and product design capabilities but not on product innovation. The effect of innovation capability and innovation orientation on product innovation was only supported for innovation capability. The effect of innovation orientation is mediated by the development of innovation capability. Research limitations/implications-The paper focusses on the level of maturity of capability development without taking into consideration the time since adoption. Also, the measure of product innovation is based on the degree of product newness but does not dichotomize in terms of radical vs incremental. Several arguments supporting a negative relationship between TQM and innovation often refer to radical or breakthrough innovation. It would be interesting to test the model while distinguishing between radical and incremental innovation. The use of cross-sectional data is a methodological limitation. Practical implications-The results suggest that managers can leverage their quality management systems to support product innovation. In particular, the ability to design quality into products leads to higher levels of strategic production innovation. The successful deployment of TQM capabilities requires an integrative and well-structured approach, involving top leadership engagement of employees and customer orientation. While TQM culture is critical to the development of quality management capabilities, it does not directly affect the innovativeness of a firm. Originality/value-The paper explores the relationship between quality management systems and strategic product innovation.

These capabilities are considered through its two dimensions: strategic market planning and marketing strategy implementation capabilities. The research outcomes allow concluding that innovation orientation positively influences innovation performance and both architectural marketing capabilities dimensions. However, the two of them are not related to innovation performance, neither have they mediated the relation between innovation orientation and innovation performance. Therefore, results indicate that marketing capabilities may not contribute to isolate company performance.

This study examined the influence of a number of factors on green innovation and the consequences in terms of performance. The stakeholder theory was adopted to observe the effects of each stakeholder on the green innovation practices of companies and to determine how green innovation practices influence environmental and business performance. A research model with eight hypotheses was proposed to determine the associations between the variables of interest. An empirical survey was conducted of 202 Taiwanese service and manufacturing companies. The survey found that pressure from competitors and the government, along with employee conduct, all had significant and positive effects on green innovation practices. Additionally, a moderating effect of innovation orientation existed only in the relationship between green product innovation practices and employee conduct. This study not only provides a systematic way to analyze the effects of green innovation practices but also suggests the best means for companies to adopt green innovation practices. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Green innovation; Performance; Stakeholder theory","Taiwan; business development; environmental issue; innovation; performance assessment; stakeholder; sustainable development","Qi G.Y., Shen L.Y., Zeng S.X., Jorge O.J., The drivers for contractors' green innovation: An industry perspective, J.

The model was built on the synthesis of strategic orientation and resource-based theory. The key mediating variable is organizational core competency. The empirical test proved that the technology innovation orientation did not affect performance directly, but through the core competency indirectly. The test results suggest that if an innovative firm would like to enhance business performance, first of all, the firm has strategic innovative orientation view and concentrates on core competency. The more a firm has core competency, the more it will increase their productivity, and finally will get higher financial performance. © 2015, ICIC International.","Core competency; Performance; Productivity; Technology innovation","Engineering research; Planning; Productivity; Strategic planning; Core competencies; Financial performance; Organizational performance; Performance; Resource-based theory; Strategic orientation; Strategic technologies; Technology innovation; Innovation","Hakala H., Strategic orientations in management literature: Three approaches to understanding the interaction between market, technology, entrepreneurial and learning orientations, International Journal of Management Reviews, 13, 2, pp. 199-217, (2011); Wernerfelt B., A resource based view of the firm, Strategic Management Journal, 5, pp. 171-180, (1984); Barney J., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage, Journal of Management, 17, 1, pp. 99-120, (1991); King W.R., Strategic planning for management information systems, MIS Quarterly, 2, 1, pp. 27-37, (1978); Gatignon H., Xuereb J.M., Strategic orientation of the firm and new product performance, Journal of Marketing Research, 34, pp. 77-90, (1997); Teece D.J., Pisano G., Shuen A., Dynamic capabilities and strategic management, Strategic Management Journal, 18, 7, pp. 509-533, (1997); Zhou K.Z., Yim C.K., Tse D.K., The effect of strategic orientations on technology and marketbased breakthrough innovations, Journal of Marketing, 69, 2, pp. 42-60, (2005); Flapper S.D., Fortuin L., Stoop P.P., Towards consistent performance management systems, International Journal of Operations and Production Management, 17, 7, pp. 27-37, (1996); March J.G., Sutton R.I., Organizational performance as a dependent variable, Organizational Science, 8, 6, pp. 698-706, (1997); Rogers P.R., Miller A., Judge W.Q., Using information processing theory to understand planning/ performance relationships in the context of strategy, Strategic Management Journal, 20, pp. 567-577, (1999); Carton R.B., Hofer C.W., Organizational financial performance: Identifying and testing multiple dimensions, Academy of Entrepreneurship Journal, 6, 1, pp. 1-22, (2010); Ramani G., Kumar V., Interaction orientation and firm performance, Journal of Marketing, 72, pp. 27-45, (2008); Gao G.Y., Zhou K.Z., Yim C.K., On what should firms focus in transitional economies?

Main variables of the research include market orientation, innovation performance, innovation orientation, technology resources and export performance. This is an applied research in terms of the objective and a descriptive-survey study in terms of implementation. Path analysis model and PLS were used to investigate the relationship among research variables and hypotheses. The data analysis and hypotheses tests show that the relationship between market orientation and innovation orientation was confirmed in the export sector of Orumiyeh Pakdis, Iran Behnoosh, and Glokozan Companies. Increasing innovation grade is resulted by increasing marketing-orientation level that leads to better export performance in the company; in this regard, the increase of innovation resources plays a significant role in innovative performance of the company; however, total factors ultimately will increase export performance directly. Generally, it can be concluded that market orientation significantly influences export performance and product innovation performance. Therefore, as a general suggestion it can be stated that by using results obtained through this practical and applied research managers of these companies can enable the organization to maintain the loyal customers by relaying on higher levels of market-orientation and innovation and consequently improve export performance of the company by implementing this strategy. © 2016, Institute of Integrative Omics and Applied Biotechnology.

Despite its apparent importance, relatively little research has addressed antecedents of a firm's strategic orientation that help explain heterogeneity in innovation strategies across firms. Especially the influence of top management teams (TMT) should be critical, since innovation strategies are shaped at the top management level. Building on the theory of upper echelon, this study investigates how TMT characteristics affect a firm's strategic innovation orientation, and how this relates to innovation outcomes and firm performance. Hypotheses are tested on a sample of goods manufacturers using a combination of survey data, document analysis, and objective capital market data for firm performance. Results indicate that TMT diversity, measured as heterogeneity in educational, functional, industry, and organizational background, has a strong positive effect on a firm's innovation orientation. A strong proactive focus on emerging customer needs and on novel technologies then lead to a portfolio of new products with higher market newness and technology newness, which both increase firm performance. The results therefore emphasize the importance of TMT characteristics as antecedent for innovation strategy and innovation outcomes. © 2011 Product Development & Management Association.","","Product development; Capital markets; Customer need; Document analysis; Firm Performance; Innovation strategy; Innovativeness; Little research; Portfolio of new products; Positive effects; Strategic orientation; Survey data; Technological solution; Top management; Top management teams; Industry","Arthur D.L., Pathways to Innovation Excellence: Results of A Global Study by Arthur D, (2010); Atuahene-Gima K., Market orientation and innovation, Journal of Business Research, 35, 2, pp. 93-103, (1996); Atuahene-Gima K., Resolving the capability-rigidity paradox in new product innovation, Journal of Marketing, 69, 4, pp. 61-83, (2005); Atuahene-Gima K., Slater S.F., Olson E.M., The contingent value of responsive and proactive market orientations for new product program performance, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 22, 6, pp. 464-482, (2005); Baker W.E., Sinkula J.M., Market orientation and the new product paradox, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 22, 6, pp. 483-502, (2005); Baker W.E., Sinkula J.M., Does market orientation facilitate balanced innovation programs?

The manufacturing strategy is posited to be influenced by customer orientation, competitor orientation, resource orientation, and innovation orientation. The findings of this study are based on a sample of the top management of 194 manufacturing concerns from the Canadian technology sector. The analysis using structural equal modelling informs that customer orientation impacts quality and flexibility strategies while competitor orientation influences cost and delivery strategies. Innovation strategy is impacted by innovation orientation. Resource orientation did not significantly impact manufacturing strategy. Quality strategy has the strongest influence on manufacturing capability, followed by cost, innovation and flexibility strategies. Manufacturing capability, in turn, influences both financial and non-financial performance.

Innovation performance is essential for enhancing hotel management performance. According to the holistic innovation paradigm, successful innovation should be holistic in nature and comprise novel, utilitarian and experiential value dimensions. Empirical findings also attest to the conduciveness of holistic innovation to heightening customer loyalty. However, the antecedents and outcome of holistic innovation are still unclear in the hotel context. The current study validates a theoretical framework via surveys administered on the chief executive officers and customers of 112 five-star hotels. As the research result suggests, ambidextrous innovation orientation and value co-creation capabilities are primary drivers of holistic innovation. In turn, the three value dimensions of holistic innovation relate positively to customer loyalty with variant effect sizes. The research result contributes to hotel management both academically and practically. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","ambidextrous innovation orientation; customer loyalty;

Yet, innovation in services, and also tourism, remain underresearched, especially in the context of the global South. This article draws on a cross-sectoral, firm-level survey of tourism innovation in the Western Cape region of South Africa, which determined that innovation by tourism firms is widespread, albeit predominantly incremental in character. This article interrogates the relationships between innovation and firm survival, as a proxy for competitiveness, and considers firm size as a key determinant of tourism innovation. In addition, the motivators and drivers of tourism innovation are analyzed. The Western Cape investigation reveals that innovation is part of a deliberate strategy for competitiveness by dynamic tourism firms. Further motivations comprise enhancing efficiency and productivity, ensuring survival, and behaving ethically. © 2017 Cognizant, LLC.","Innovation determinants; Innovation orientation; Tourism competitiveness; Tourism innovation","","Ahmad J.A., Abdurahman A.Z.A., Ali J.K., Khedif L.Y.B., Bohari Z., Social entrepreneurship in ecotourism: An opportunity for fishing village of Sebuyau, Sarawak Borneo, Tourism, Leisure and Global Change, 1, pp. 1-39, (2014); Alsos G.A., Clausen T.H., The start-up processes of tourism firms: The use of causation and effectuation strategies, Handbook of research on innovation in tourism industries, pp. 181-203, (2014); Alsos G.A., Eide D., Madsen E.L., Innovation in tourism industries, Handbook of research on innovation in tourism industries, pp. 1-26, (2014); Babbie E., Mouton J., The practice of social research, (2005); Barcet A., Innovation in services: A new paradigm and innovation model, The handbook of innovation in services: A multidisciplinary perspective, pp. 49-67, (2010); Baumol W.J., The free-market innovation machine: Analysing the growth miracle, (2002); Berne C., Garcia-Gonzalez M., Garcia-Uceda M.E., Mugica J.M., The effect of ICT on relationship enhancement and performance in tourism channels, Tourism Management, 48, pp. 188-198, (2015); Bicen P., Johnson W., How do firms innovate with limited resources in turbulent markets?, Innovation: Management, Policy and Practice, 16, 3, pp. 430-444, (2014); Booyens I., Are small, medium and micro-sized enterprises engines of innovation?

Although recent work has begun the arduous process of testing effectuation’s effect on entrepreneurial performance, there is still much to learn about its impact on firm performance. One such area is the relationship between effectuation and innovation. The purpose of this paper is to first, propose a scale suitable to the explication of the effectuation construct relative to innovation. Second, it proposes a more parsimonious scale for the measurement of innovation. Third, these scales are tested relative to firm performance. Design/methodology/approach – This paper develops and tests a structural model, which investigates aspects of effectuation as mediators between innovation orientation and product/service innovation. This is accomplished using a sample of 169 electronic product manufacturing-based small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Subjective measures of performance are used as the dependent variable. Findings – The three most widely used measures of innovativeness were found to break cleanly into two sub-constructs, namely innovation orientation and product/service innovation. Effectuation measures included means (who I know), leverage contingencies (experimentation), pre-commitments and affordable loss. Means and leverage contingencies were found to positively mediate innovation orientation and product/service innovation leading to increased firm performance. Affordable loss did not show a mediating role, but had a direct effect on firm performance. Research limitations/implications – This study establishes two distinct sub-constructs of firm-level innovation; namely innovation orientation and product/service innovation. Second, by testing an innovation-centric effectuation model, this research establishes an empirical relationship between effectuation, innovation and firm performance. Practical implications – Practical implications include establishing a relationship between means, leverage contingencies and innovation-performance, indicating that the ways through which small and medium-sized enterprises use their innovation networks may affect innovation outcomes and ultimately firm performance. Originality/value – This research establishes an empirical relationship between effectuation, innovation and firm performance, extending effectuation theory from the entrepreneurship to the innovation literature. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Affordable loss;

As Chinese firms expand their production networks, their performance may improve due to their innovative use of such networks to diffuse information/knowledge. However, a survey of 171 Chinese firms found that simultaneously pursuing both central and intermediate network positions creates conflict even though both positions positively affect performance. Innovation orientation and environmental dynamics are the areas in which network position affects performance. In highly dynamic environments and for firms with innovation orientations, an intermediate position can improve performance. Conversely, central positions can improve performance for high innovation orientations in less dynamic environments. These results indicate that firms should consider the fitness of the various network positions, innovation strategies and environmental dynamics when expanding their production networks.

Design/methodology/approach – A questionnaire survey was conducted among 281 small and medium-sized and 222 large manufacturing exporters in mainland China. Research hypotheses were examined by structural equation modeling technique. Findings – The research results show that: market orientation (MO) and innovation orientation (IO) are not significantly different between large exporters and SMEs, while new product performance of SMEs is significantly less satisfactory; for large exporters, perceived environmental uncertainties in terms of technology and customer demands are critical driving factors of strategic orientations, while environmental dynamics in terms of technology and competition have significant impacts upon strategic orientations among SMEs; while MO plays a stronger effect in product innovation performance for large exporters, IO has equally important impact upon new product success across SMEs and large exporters. Originality/value – The authors extend the established theory about industry environment, strategic orientations and product innovation performance from companies in developed countries and domestic market to firms from developing countries who are operating in export markets. Furthermore, it is first kind of study that comparatively examines the relationship among environmental turbulence, strategic orientations and product innovation performance by company size. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Innovation orientation; Market orientation; New product success; Perceived environmental turbulence; SMEs","","Al-Hakim L.A.Y., Shahizan H., Knowledge management strategies, innovation, and organisational performance, Journal of Advances in Management Research, 10, 1, pp. 58-71, (2013); Alpkan L., Yilmaz C., Kaya N., Market orientation and planning flexibility in SMEs : performance implications and an empirical investigation, International Small Business Journal, 25, 2, pp. 152-172, (2007); Anderson V., Boocock G., Small firms and internationalisation: learning to manage and managing to learn, Human Resource Management Journal, 12, 3, pp. 5-24, (2002); Augusto M., Coelho F., Market orientation and new-to-the-world products: exploring the moderating effects of innovativeness, competitive strength, and environmental forces, Industrial Marketing Management, 38, 1, pp. 94-108, (2009); Baker W.E., Sinkula J.M., The synergistic effect of market orientation and learning orientation on organizational performance, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 27, 4, pp. 411-427, (1999); Berthon P., Hulbert J., Pitt L., To serve or to create?

How do media owners and content producers move toward a more reciprocal and interactive business strategy to deal with the change? Design/methodology/approach: The study was qualitative and exploratory in nature and utilized in-depth and semi-structured interviews of media consumers and experts. Findings: Consumer behavior has changed due to increased product control, in terms of type and occasion, across all income levels. The value of curatorship has increased and social media has fundamentally changed consumption patterns. Using the Berthon et al. model of response functions, we found that, content producers often suffer from inertia and operate with an Isolate strategy. The second most common approach is that of Follow or customer orientation. There is limited engagement with the innovation orientations of Shape and Interact. It is best for the industry to move toward an Interact model, accepting that consumers sometimes wish to create and at other times wish content to be effortlessly provided to them. Research limitations/implications: This study adopted a qualitative approach of industry experts and consumers within a single context. The further implications would be to develop the Interact strategy in more detail, especially toward the end of how to get media providers to change their current orientations. Practical implications: Business models of product producers in the new business environment seek to be more consumer-centric. This must not be done at the expense of an innovation orientation. Originality/value: There has been a lot of discussion on the need to change business models in the wake of changed consumer behavior. The current paper provides guidance on how to respond to the new media world. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Computer-mediated communication; Consumer empowerment; Customer-orientation; Innovation; Innovation management; Integrated marketing communications; Market orientation; Media business models; New media; New product management","","Agee J., Developing qualitative research questions: a reflective process, International Journal of Qualitative Studies in Education, 22, 4, pp. 431-447, (2009); Anderson C., Wolff M., The web is dead: long live the internet, Wired Magazine, (2010); Bandyopadhyay S., Gupta K., Comparing double jeopardy effects at the behavioral and attitudinal levels, The Journal of Product and Brand Management, 13, 2-3, pp. 180-191, (2004); Bardhi F., Rohm A.J., Sultan F., Tuning in and tuning out: media multitasking among young consumers, Journal of Consumer Behaviour, 9, 4, pp. 316-332, (2010); Berman S.J., Digital transformation: opportunities to create new business models, Strategy & Leadership, 40, 2, pp. 16-24, (2012); Berman S.J., Abraham S., Battino B., Shipnuck L., Neus A., New business models for the new media world, Strategy & Leadership, 35, 4, (2007); Berman S.J., Battino B., Feldman K., New business models for emerging media and entertainment revenue opportunities, Strategy & Leadership, 39, 3, pp. 44-53, (2011); Berman S.J., Marshall A., The next digital transformation: from an individual-centered to an everyone-to-everyone economy, Strategy & Leadership, 42, 5, pp. 9-17, (2014); Berthon P., Hulbert J.M., Pitt L.F., To serve or create?

The focus was on national background and entrepreneurship education as the contextual factors and innovation and locus of control orientation as the personal traits. The effects were investigated comparing a sample of Chinese students to a sample of students from developed countries. Results indicate that both context factors are relevant and affect personal traits in different ways: entrepreneurial intentions and innovation orientations of Chinese students can be related to the country's transitional stage from a manufacturing-driven to an innovation-driven base, whereas the level of internal locus of control can be explained by the cultural background. Education has similar impacts on both samples and seems to reduce cultural differences. Furthermore, China's next generation of entrepreneurs is expected to have great innovative potential; however, there is a time lag to realisation, compared to that of developed countries.

In this paper we suggest the kinds of innovation activity undertaken by an SME will depend on their dominant business model and owner/enterprise attitudes, each one being moderated by purposeful networking. This is illustrated in our review of data from 50 case studies, where combining a CEO narrative analysis with secondary data on the nature of the firm has identified seven generic manufacturing business models. We observe these may be adopted singly or in combination to pursue a competitive advantage, and the dominant business model may change over time as new capabilities are developed and/or in response to market changes. © 2018 Universidade do Porto - Faculdade de Engenharia.","Business Model; Discontinuous Innovation; Innovation; Manufacturing; Networks; SMEs","","Inside the Innovation Matrix: Finding the hidden human dimensions, (2008); Australian Bureau of Statistics 2012, (2012); Alexander A.T., Childe S.J., Innovation: A Knowledge Transfer Perspective, Production, Planning and Control, 24, 2-3, pp. 208-225, (2013); Alguezaui S, Filieri R., Investigating the role of social capital in innovation: sparse versus dense network, Journal of Knowledge Management, 14, 6, pp. 891-909, (2010); Allison T.

Design/methodology/approach – This study utilizes multi-group path analysis and confirmatory factor analysis in LISREL on data from 228 firms in the Australian service sector. Findings – This study establishes that both customer and competitor innovation are positively related to exploitative and exploratory innovation. However, customer orientation does not lead to significantly stronger effects on exploitative innovation than on exploratory innovation, and competitor orientation does not lead to significantly stronger effects on exploratory innovation than on exploitative innovation. In addition, the study found that the relationship between customer orientation and exploratory innovation was stronger for family firms, while the relationships between competitor orientation and both exploratory and exploitative innovation were stronger for non-family firms. Research limitations/implications – The cross-sectional design is one weakness of this study. In addition, as firms in the present study came from the service sector the generalizability of the findings to other sectors of the economy need to be determined. Practical implications – These findings of this study highlight the need for managers to build a strong market orientation in order to promote innovation, and consider the effects of ownership structure on innovation strategies. Originality/value – This study is the first to measure the relative influence of customer and competitor orientation on a firm’s use of exploitative and exploratory innovation strategies. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Family business; Innovation orientation; Market orientation","","Armstrong J.S., Overton T.S., Estimating nonresponse bias in mail surveys, Journal of Marketing Research, 14, 3, pp. 396-402, (1977); Arregle J.L., Hitt M., Sirmon D.G., Very P., The development of organizational social capital: attributes of family firms, Journal of Management Studies, 44, 1, pp. 73-95, (2007); Athuahene-Gima K., An exploratory analysis of the impact of market orientation on new product performance: a contingency approach, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 12, 4, pp. 275-293, (1995); Athuahene-Gima K., Market orientation and innovation, Journal of Business Research, 35, 2, pp. 93-103, (1996); Athuahene-Gima K., Resolving the capability-rigidity paradox in new product innovation, Journal of Marketing, 69, 4, pp. 61-83, (2005); Avlonitis G.J., Giannopoulos A.A., Balanced market orientation: qualitative findings on a fragile equilibrium, Managing Service Quality, 22, 6, pp. 565-579, (2012); Beck L., Janssens W., Debruyne M., Lommelen T., A study of the relationships between generation, market orientation, and innovation in family firms, Family Business Review, 24, 3, pp. 252-272, (2011); Benner M.J., Tushman M.L., Exploitation, exploration, and process management: the productivity dilemma revisited, Academy of Management Review, 28, 2, pp. 238-256, (2003); Carney M., Corporate governance and competitive advantage in family firms, Entrepreneurship: Theory & Practice, 29, 3, pp. 249-265, (2005); Chang Y.Y., Hughes M., Drivers of innovation ambidexterity in small- to medium-sized firms, European Management Journal, 30, 1, pp. 1-17, (2012); Christensen C., The Innovator’s Dilemma, (1997); Christensen C., Bower J.L., Customer power, strategic investment, and the failure of leading firms, Strategic Management Journal, 17, 3, pp. 197-218, (1996); Christensen C., Cook S., Hall T., Marketing malpractice, Harvard Business Review, 12, December, pp. 74-83, (2005); Chua J.H., Chrisman J.J., Sharma P., Defining the family business by behavior, Entrepreneurship: Theory and Practice, 23, 1, pp. 19-39, (1999); De Massis A., Frattini F., Pizzurno E., Cassia L., Product innovation in family versus nonfamily firms: an exploratory analysis, Journal of Small Business Management, 53, 1, pp. 1-36, (2015); Deng Z., Hofman P.S., Newman A., Ownership concentration and product innovation in Chinese private SMEs, Asia-Pacific Journal of Management, 30, 3, pp. 717-734, (2013); Dyer W.G., Examining the ‘family effect’ on firm performance, Family Business Review, 19, 4, pp. 253-273, (2006); Eddleston K.A., Kellermanns F.W., Sarathy R., Resource configuration in family firms: linking resources, strategic planning, and technological opportunities to performance, Journal of Management Studies, 45, 1, pp. 26-50, (2008); Gomez-Mejia L.R., Nunez-Nickel M., Gutierrez I., The role of family ties in agency contracts, Academy of Management Journal, 44, 1, pp. 81-95, (2001); Grinstein A., The effect of market orientation and its components on innovation consequences: a meta-analysis, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 36, 2, pp. 166-173, (2008); Habbershon T.G., Williams M.L., A resource-based framework for assessing the strategic advantages of family firms, Family Business Review, 12, 1, pp. 1-25, (1999); Institute for Family Business I.F.F.B., The UK Family Business Sector.

This study examines the agriculture entrepreneurship and farmers' performance in the context of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). A survey was conducted to collect primary data from three agricultural zones adjacent to the under-construction CPEC in Pakistan. According to the results, market orientation, entrepreneurial orientation, innovation orientation, and opportunity recognition positively influence agriculture entrepreneurship thereby facilitating timely distribution of food commodities in ensuring food security. Our findings also indicate that uptake of entrepreneurship complements farmers' marketing, operational and economic performance. These findings do imply that improving farmers' entrepreneurial skills is the essential element for their improved performance in terms of locating potential markets and timely delivery of primary commodities, such as food items. It suggests that farmers might seek enormous economic opportunities arising from improved infrastructure, output linkages, connectivity and access to global markets through the CPEC. Based on the findings, the study provides implications for policymakers to channelize the potential endeavors for facilitating the farmers' access to new markets and getting the foremost advantage of Belt and Road Initiative. The study also extends the existing literature on agriculture entrepreneurship-opportunity recognition and access to new markets in a befitting manner. © 2019 by the authors.","Agriculture entrepreneurship; Belt and Road Initiative; Food distribution; Infrastructure; Market; Performance","Pakistan; agricultural performance; agroindustry; commodity; economic activity; entrepreneur; food; food policy; food security; market system; policy making; spatial distribution","Fitz-Koch S., Nordqvist M., Carter S., Hunter E., Entrepreneurship in the agricultural sector: A literature review and future research opportunities, Entrep.

The present study aims to bridge this gap by examining the impact of a set of organizational elements on the service-enhancement in a sample of ICT manufacturing enterprises in China. The results of a multivariate analysis indicate that the degree of service-enhancement (measured by product, customer and financial performance) can be well explained by five organizational elements (service technological capability, strategic orientation (including market and innovation orientation), organization design, and resources endowment). Therefore, it is necessary for firms to consider organizational elements in implementing servitization in manufacturing firms. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Manufacturing; Organizational elements; Service-enhancement; Servitization","China; Developing countries; Multivariant analysis; Product design; Financial performance; Manufacturing enterprise; Manufacturing firms; Multi variate analysis; Service enhancement; Servitization; Strategic orientation; Technological capability; developing world; empirical analysis; industrial performance; information and communication technology; innovation; manufacturing; organizational framework; service provision; Manufacture","Lightfoot H., Baines T., Smart P., The servitization of manufacturing: a systematic literature review of interdependent trends, Int.

Design/methodology/approach – In this paper, we use text mining and principal component analysis to analyze the classification and measurement of technology innovation policy based on data obtained from Zhongguancun Science Park. Findings – The empirical results indicate that regional science and technology innovation policy can be divided into four types: authoritative, guiding, urgent and periodical. The key measurements are function type, intensity, resource supply, funding level and funding effectiveness. Originality/value – A comparative analysis is performed to investigate the different types of regional science and technology innovation policy measurement. Additionally, the study’s limitations are discussed, and future research directions are proposed. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Development; Innovation; Planning; Science and technology; Strategy","Data mining; Engineering research; Text processing; Design/methodology/approach; Development; Innovation; Innovation policies; Measurements of; Principal-component analysis; Science and Technology; Science park; Strategy; Text-mining; Principal component analysis","Bataille C., Jaccard M., Nyboer J., Rivers N., Towards general equilibrium in a technology-rich model with empirically estimated behavioral parameters.

A total of 480 questionnaires were collected from companies in the Taiwanese electronics industry. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed to analyze the collected data. An innovation orientation was shown to positively affect supply chain integration, combinative competitive capabilities, and firm performance. Supply chain integration (in particular, supplier integration and internal integration) had a mediation effect on innovation orientation and business performance, whereas combinative competitive capabilities had a mediation effect on supply chain integration and firm performance. The results provide empirical support for the notion that an innovation orientation affects supply chain integration and firm performance. Drawing from previous studies on resource dependence theory, this study indicates how innovation orientation assists firms in integrating their supply chains and realizing the potential of the supply chain management mechanism. This paper presents the interrelatedness of innovation orientation, supply chain integration, combinative competitive capabilities, and firm performance. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We used the data from the 2003–2008 Global Entrepreneurship Monitor Adult Population Survey for 3,098 SeEC and 3,626 WEC entrepreneurs. The results show that 1) a firm’s high level of competition inhibits its growth aspirations in both regions, albeit more so in SeECs; 2) innovative products/services stimulate firm growth aspirations in WECs only; and 3) international orientation stimulates firm growth aspirations in both regions, albeit more so in WECs. © Rainer Hampp Verlag.","Early-stage entrepreneurs; Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM); Growth aspirations; Innovation orientation; International orientation","","Acs Z., Regional Innovation, Knowledge and Global Change, (2000); Acs Z.J., Anselin L., Varga A., Patents and innovation counts as measures of regional production of new knowledge, Research Policy, 31, 7, pp. 1069-1085, (2002); Acs Z.J., Audretsch D.B., Braunerhjelm P., Carlsson B., The knowledge spillover theory of entrepreneurship, Center for Economic Policy Research, 5326, (2005); Ajzen I., The theory of planned behaviour, Organizational Behavior and Human Processes, 50, pp. 179-211, (1991); Andersson M., Loof H., Learning-by-exporting revisited: The role of intensity and persistence, The Scandinavian Journal of Economics, 111, 4, pp. 893-916, (2009); Autio E., Global Entrepreneurship Report, (2007); Autio E., Acs Z., Institutional influence on strategic entrepreneurial behaviours, Jena Economic Research Papers in Economics, (2009); Autio E., Sapienza H.J., Almeida J.G., Effects of age at entry, knowledge intensity, and imitability on international growth, Academy of Management Journal, 43, 5, pp. 909-924, (2000); Bosma N., Wennekers S., Amoros J.E., Global Entrepreneurship monitor–2011 Extended Report: Entrepreneurial Employees across the Globe, (2012); Bosma N.S., Schutjens V.A.J.M., Outlook on Europe: Patterns of promising entrepreneurial activity in European regions, Tijdschrift Voor Economische En Sociale Geografie, 98, 5, pp. 675-686, (2007); Bosma N.S., Schutjens V.A.J.M., Understanding regional variation in entrepreneurial activity and entrepreneurial attitude in Europe, The Annals of Regional Science, 47, 3, pp. 711-742, (2011); Braczyk H., Cooke P., Heidenreich M., Regional Innovation Systems: The Role of Governances in a Globalized World, (1998); Cassar G., Money, money, money?

Yet, innovation research has mostly focused on individual new product projects, and their performance and impact on firm performance. Recent research has started to apply a more holistic view in terms of innovation, by considering firm-wide innovation instead of single new products. Upper echelon research has concentrated on direct relationships between top management team characteristics and organizational outcomes. But recent research calls for mediating effects of the relationship between top management team characteristics and organizational outcomes. Hence, this study introduces firm innovativeness as a mediator between top management team innovation orientation and firm growth. Focusing on small and medium-sized firms, which often represent highly innovative firms, results show that firm innovativeness fully mediates the relationship between top management team innovation orientation and firm growth. Implications and future research are discussed. © 2015 Imperial College Press.","firm growth; firm innovativeness; innovation orientation; small and medium-sized firms; Top management team; upper echelon theory","","Acs Z.J., Carlsson B., Karlsson C., The linkages among entrepreneurship, SMEs and the macroeconomy, Entrepreneurship, Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises and the Macroeconomy, pp. 3-42, (1999);

Patent analysis is largely used in innovation studies to assess and monitor technological changes in different sectors. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive view of the innovative forces affecting the retailing sector, by focusing on the evaluation of innovation levels through the classification and analysis of patented innovations. The findings show that retailers might shift to more innovation-oriented strategies in order to propose innovative consumer solutions, due to the support of the technology advancements highlighted by the strong patent track record. Our study contributes to the literature by providing empirical evidence of critical areas for innovation in retailing and by offering bibliometric and patent analytical methods measures relative to the innovative forces affecting retailing, which might push the sector to be increasingly an innovation-oriented one. Finally, the high level of property rights (defined by the huge amount of patents) pushes retailers to invest more on acquiring patented technologies to achieve advantages over competitors or to adopt novel management practices as substitutes for patents. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Innovation management; Patent analysis; Retailing; Technology management","analytical method; competitiveness; empirical analysis; innovation; retailing; technological change; technological development","Abraham B.J., Moitra S.D., Innovation assessment through patent analysis, Technovation, 21, 4, pp. 245-252, (2001); Alfano M., Pagnotta L., Pantano M.F., A review of patented works on the mechanical characterization of material at micro- and nano-scale, Recent Pat.

Design/methodology/approach – A structured survey was conducted among 105 firms in the Malaysian construction industry. The results of the factor analysis revealed two underlying dimensions of innovation, namely, innovation creation and innovation adoption. For the cluster analysis, the firms were segmented into four subgroups according to four dimensions, namely, non-innovative, innovation-creator, imitator and innovative firms. Findings – Firm’s business scale and age significantly affected the innovation orientation of construction firms. Originality/value – This research contributes to the existing body of knowledge by adding a new firm characteristic, business scale, as a potential predictor of firms’ innovativeness. This study is the first to explore the effect of firm characteristics on the innovation orientation of firms. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Construction industry; Firm characteristics;

Although sustainable market orientation (SMO) bears on academic accreditation, to date, no study has developed a valid scale of SMO or assessed its influence on accreditation. The purpose of this paper is to construct and validate an SMO scale that was developed in Egyptian faculties. SMO is identified as a one-dimensional construct consisting of four overlapping components. Using a survey, data were collected from 204 respondents in 6 Egyptian-accredited governmental faculties. Both item analysis and split-half methods were used to purify the measurement scale and assess its stability. Exploratory factor analysis was used to assess dimensionality, and confirmatory factor analysis was used to examine the construct and convergent/discriminant validity. Nomological validity was assessed with a structural equation model. Results suggest both a validated scale and empirical evidence of the influence of SMO on academic accreditation. © 2014, Taylor & Francis.","Egyptian-accredited faculties; innovation orientation; market orientation; stakeholder orientation; value co-creating orientation","","Aaker D.A., Kumar V.I., Day G.S., Leone P.R., Marketing research, (2011); Alhakimi W., Baharun R., A synthesis model of market orientation constructs toward building customer value: A theoretical perspective, African Journal of Marketing Management, 1, 2, pp. 43-49, (2009); Anderson J.C., Gerbing D.W., Structural equation modeling in practice: A review and recommended two-step approach, Psychological Bulletin, 103, 3, pp. 411-423, (1988); Antonio A.L., Astin H.S., Cress C.M., Community service in higher education: A look at the nation's faculty, Review of Higher Education, 23, 4, pp. 373-397, (2000); Asiad Y., Cohen G., Melewar T.C., (2007); Bacow L., Moomaw W., (2007); Barner A., Achatz R., Schweer D., (2011); Belz B., Martin F., Peattie K., (2010); Berman S.L., Wicks A.C., Kotha S., Jones T.M., Does stakeholder orientation matter?

The findings indicate that co-production positively influences service innovation to a degree that depends on the collaborative partner's compatibility and history of business relations, affective commitment, and expertise. Moreover, the business' innovation orientation enhances (moderates) the relationship between co-production and service innovation. These results have several managerial implications. Businesses should choose co-production partners that are compatible and can contribute toward advancing the relationship. Furthermore, investments in building their innovation orientation will strengthen their efforts in service innovation through co-production. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Affective commitment; Co-production; Innovation orientation; Partner expertise; Partner match; Service innovation","","Abramovici M., Bancel-Charensol L., How to take customers into consideration in service innovation projects, Service Industries Journal, 24, 1, pp. 56-78, (2004); Achrol R.S., Kotler P., Marketing in the network economy, Journal of Marketing, 63, pp. 146-164, (1999); Agarwal R., Selen W., Dynamic capability building in service value networks for achieving service innovation, Decision Sciences, 40, 3, pp. 431-475, (2009); Ahuja G., Collaboration networks, structural holes, and innovation: longitudinal study, Administrative Science Quarterly, 45, 3, pp. 425-455, (2000); Alam I., Removing the fuzziness from the fuzzy front-end of service innovations through customer interactions, Industrial Marketing Management, 35, 4, pp. 468-480, (2006); Amabile T.M., A model of creativity and innovation in organizations, Research in organizational behavior, (1988); Armstrong J.S., Overton T.S., Estimating non-response bias in mail surveys, Journal of Marketing Research, 14, 3, pp. 396-402, (1997); Athaide G.A., Stump R.L., A taxonomy of relationship approaches during product development in technology-based, industrial markets, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 16, 5, pp. 469-482, (1999); Auh S., Bell S.J., McLeod C.S., Shih E., Co-production and customer loyalty in financial services, Journal of Retailing, 83, 3, pp. 359-370, (2007); Avlonitis G.J., Papastathopoulou P.G., Gounaris S.P., An empirically-based typology of product innovativeness for new financial services: Success and failure scenarios, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 18, pp. 324-342, (2001); Ballantyne D., Aitken R., Branding in B2B markets: Insights from the service-dominant logic of marketing, Journal of Business & Industrial Marketing, 22, 6, pp. 363-371, (2007); Ballantyne D., Varey R.J., The service-dominant logic and the future of marketing, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 36, 1, pp. 11-14, (2008); Bendapudi N., Leone R.P., Psychological implications of customer participation in co-production, Journal of Marketing, 67, 1, pp. 14-28, (2003); Berry L.L., Shankar V., Parish J.T., Cadwallader S., Dotzel T., Creating new markets through service innovation, Sloan Management Review, 47, 2, pp. 56-63, (2006); Berthon P., Hulbert J.M., Pitt L.F., To service or create?

However, innovation remains challenging in the construction industry, partially due to the complex nature of this industry. Nevertheless, innovation orientations (i.e. creation and adoption) shed new light on innovation in the construction industry. These orientations are similar but not entirely identical. Although most studies do not discuss these orientations in any detail, this study aims to classify the characteristics of the innovation orientations and determines the state of innovation among construction companies in Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach: A survey questionnaire was mailed to 1,230 construction companies in Malaysia. Descriptive analysis was used to examine the respondents’ profiles, and factor analysis was used to classify the innovation orientation characteristics. A paired samples t-test was used to determine the state of innovation among the construction companies. Findings: Innovation creation reflects a pioneer’s efforts and involves being a market explorer that tolerates risk and is research and development (R&D)-oriented, whereas innovation adoption involves being a creative imitator, a market follower and a safe player. Construction companies in Malaysia are innovation adoption–oriented. Research limitations/implications: This study uses quantitative methods only; therefore, the findings are statistically oriented. The small sample size makes generalisation challenging, so this study reflects only the built environment of the developing country of Malaysia. Originality/value: This study classifies the characteristics of innovation creation and innovation adoption with respect to the innovation orientation of construction companies in Malaysia. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Construction companies; Innovation adoption; Innovation creation; Innovation orientation; Malaysia","Commerce; Construction; Developing countries; Surveys; Built environment; Construction companies; Descriptive analysis; Design/methodology/approach; Innovation adoption; Malaysia; Quantitative method; Small Sample Size; Construction industry","Abdul-Aziz A.R., Construction entrepreneurship in Terengganu, Malaysia: an exploration of the influential forces, Journal of Engineering, Design and Technology, 1, 1, pp. 15-41, (2003); Abdullah N.H., Shamsuddin A., Wahab E., Hamid N.A.A., The relationship between organizational culture and product innovativeness, Procedia – Social and Behavioral Sciences, 129, pp. 140-147, (2014); Abu-Jarad I., The relationship between organizational innovativeness and organizational performance: a study on housing developers in Peninsular Malaysia, (2011); Agarwal R., Bayus B.L., The market evolution and sales takeoff of product innovations, Management Science, 48, 8, pp. 1024-1041, (2002); Ahmed P.K., Culture and climate for innovation, European Journal of Innovation Management, 1, 1, pp. 30-43, (1998); Akintoye A., Analysis of factors influencing project cost estimating practice, Construction Management and Economics, 18, 1, pp. 77-89, (2000); Anderson N., Potocnik K., Zhou J., Innovation and creativity in organizations: a state-of-the-science review, prospective commentary, and guiding framework, Journal of Management, 40, 5, pp. 1297-1333, (2014); Angle H.L., Van de Ven A.H., Suggestions for managing the innovation journey, Research on the Management of Innovation: The Minnesota Studies, pp. 663-697, (2000); Arundel A., Lorenz E., Lundvall B.A.K., Valeyre A., How Europe’s economies learn: a comparison of work organization and innovation mode for the EU-15, Industrial and Corporate Change, 16, 6, pp. 1175-1210, (2007); Barlow J., Innovation and learning in complex offshore construction projects, Research Policy, 29, 7-8, pp. 973-989, (2000); Baumann J., Kritikos A.S., The link between R&D, innovation and productivity: are micro firms different?, Research Policy, 45, 6, pp. 1263-1274, (2016); Bishop D., Felstead A., Fuller A., Jewson N., Kakavelakis K., Unwin L., Constructing learning: adversarial and collaborative working in the British construction industry, (2008); Blayse A.M., Manley K., Key influences on construction innovation, Construction Innovationt, 4, 3, pp. 143-154, (2004); Blismas N., Wakefield R., Hauser B., Concrete prefabricated housing via advances in systems technologies, Engineering, Construction and Architectural Management, 17, 1, pp. 99-110, (2010); Brochner J., Construction contractors as service innovators, Building Research and Information, 38, 3, pp. 235-246, (2010); Bygballea L.E., Ingemansson M., The logic of innovation in construction, Industrial Marketing Management, 43, 3, pp. 512-524, (2014); Annual report 2013, (2014); Quarterly bulletin: fourth quarter 2014, developments in the Malaysia economy, (2014); Annual report 2015, (2016); Chen L., Mohamed S., The strategic importance of tacit knowledge management activities in construction, Construction Innovation, 10, 2, pp. 138-163, (2010); Cheung S.O., Wong P.S.P., Lam A.L., An investigation of the relationship between organizational culture and the performance of construction organizations, Journal of Business Economics and Management, 13, 4, pp. 688-704, (2012); Chia F.C., Construction and economic development: the case of Malaysia, International Journal of Construction Management, 12, 1, pp. 23-35, (2012); Chiang Y., Tang B., Submarines don’t leak, why do buildings?

It finds that the positive linkage between business ties and exploratory innovation is jointly strengthened by innovation orientation and absorptive capacity, while the insignificant linkage of political ties to exploratory innovation is moderated negatively by the interaction of innovation orientation and absorptive capacity. This study enriches the discipline's knowledge on the antecedents of exploratory innovation. Moreover, it contextualizes the effiects of managerial ties on an important but overlooked type of innovation - exploratory innovation - and illustrates how a firm can integrate managerial ties with innovation orientation and absorptive capacity to realize their implications for exploratory innovation, which advances our understanding of the relationships between managerial ties and firm innovations. © 1988-2012 IEEE.","Absorptive capacity; business ties; exploratory innovation; innovation orientation; political ties; the opportunity-motivation-ability perspective","Couplings; Knowledge engineering; Motivation; Trajectories; Absorptive capacity; Collaboration; Government; opportunity-motivation-ability perspective; political ties; Technological innovation; Managers","Jansen J.J.P., Van Den Bosch F.A.J., Volberda H.W., Exploratory innovation, exploitative innovation, and performance: Effects of organizational antecedents and environmental moderators, Manage.

Design/methodology/approach – A qualitative study of 11 PHCs in central Sweden was conducted to classify their positions in the typology. Interviews with semi-structured and open-ended questions were used to collect the data. Findings – Four PHC types were identified by combining high and low MO and IO. This study offers insights on the importance of combining MO and IO. The overall findings show that MO and IO combination is not static and must be handled according to context. The MO-IO typology developed could be tested in a quantitative study on a larger sample of public or combined public and private housing companies. Research limitations/implications – An empirical study comparing public and private housing companies on the basis of the proposed typology in relation to economic contingencies in the environment would further knowledge in this area. Practical implications – The current study gives managers an indication of their position in the typology, which can be used as a tool for improving performance. Originality/value – This paper describes PHCs within a proposed typological framework. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Economy; Innovation; Market orientation","","Atuahene-Gima K., Market orientation and innovation, Journal of Business Research, 35, 1, pp. 93-103, (1996);

Design/methodology/approach – To undertake this examination, a model was developed and then tested to validate its applicability in the context of both developed and developing economies. The paper includes partial least squares. Findings – The findings demonstrate that being marketingoriented and innovationoriented appears to be important in creating customers, keeping them, and increasing addon selling to them and rewards the firm with greater brand performance in the marketplace. Importantly, these relationships are universally held across developed and developing business environments. Interestingly, marketing orientation was found to contribute more to the creation of customercentric value than innovation orientation in developing business environment, whereas the opposite was found in the context of developed business environment. Research limitations/implications – The data incorporate only the subjective measures of customercentric value. Future studies can use financial measures to complement the selfreporting approach used in this paper. This dualapproach to measuring the value of customers to the firm (customer equity) and brand performance would provide additional insights into the customercentric marketing literature. Practical implications – The findings suggest that managers should strive to develop a high level of marketing orientation and innovation orientation as two efficient ways to achieve higher levels of customer equity. They are also advised that if their firms are more effective in acquiring potential customers, retaining current customers, and enhancing addon selling, they see their brands perform better. Importantly, the findings also provide guidance for managers on how to allocate their resources to key business activities (e.g. marketing and innovation) in the context of international business (developing versus developed business environments). Originality/value – This study contributes to customercentric marketing theory by enhancing understanding of the contribution of marketing and innovation to the creation of customercentric value in different business environments. This study also contributes to the business orientation literature by demonstrating the utility of a culturalbehavioral approach in measuring marketing orientation and innovation orientation. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Australia; Cross cultural studies; Customer relations; Innovation; Manufacturing industries; Market orientation; Marketing; Vietnam","","Aaker D.A., Jacobson R., The financial information content of perceived quality, Journal of Marketing Research, 31, pp. 191-201, (1994); Aksoy L., Cooil B., Groening C., Keiningham T.L., Yalcin A., The long-term stock market valuation of customer satisfaction, Journal of Marketing, 72, 4, pp. 105-122, (2008); American Marketing Association: An Association for the Advancement of Science in Marketing, Proposal for Constitution and By-laws, (1937); Marketing Definitions: A Glossary of Marketing Terms, (1960); Marketing definitions, (1985); Marketing definitions, (2004); Marketing definitions, (2007); Amabile T.M., Conti R., Coon H., Lazenby J., Herron M., Assessing the work environment for creativity, Academy of Management Journal, 39, 5, pp. 1154-1184, (1996); Amato S., Vinzi V.E., Tenenhaus M., A global goodness-of-fit index for PLS structural equation modelling, Oral Communication to PLS Club, (2004); Ambler T., Bhattacharya C.B., Edell J., Keller K.L., Lemon K.N., Mittal V., Relating brand and customer perspectives on marketing management, Journal of Service Research, 5, 1, pp. 13-25, (2002); Atuahene-Gima K., Slater S.F., Olson E.M., The contingent value of responsive and proactive market orientations for new product program performance, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 22, 6, pp. 464-482, (2005); Berthon P., Hulbert J.M., Pitt L., To serve or to create?

It is however not entirely clear what it is proactive firms actually do to achieve success. By investigating proactive firms' market strategies, i.e. the sets of activities they perform in order to create superior customer value, a holistic overview of the activities involved in proactive market strategies is provided. Through a case study of five proactive firms, proactive activities are identified. Using three strategic orientations—customer, competition, and innovation orientation—unique proactivity profiles are created, reflecting the patterns in the identified proactive activities. Through these profiles, three overarching proactive market strategies are forwarded: market shaping, customer engagement, and innovation leadership. These are proposed to act as generic proactive market strategies, representing coordinated proactive activities driven by multiple strategic orientations and aimed at creating customer value.

Organizational culture (OC) has been defined as a pattern of basic assumptions that are manifested by the behavior of an organization. Positive OC is considered to be catalytic to performance enhancement. As construction aspires to be an efficient industry, this study aims to contribute in this regard by examining the relationship between organizational culture and the performance of construction organizations. Artifacts corresponding to OC identifiers and Performance indicators are short-listed from a literature review. These artifacts are arranged into constructs. The eight OC constructs are: Goal Clarity, Coordination and Integration, Conflict Resolution, Employee Participation, Innovation Orientation, Performance Emphasis, Reward Orientation and Team orientation. The performance indicator constructs are; Financial, Internal Business Process, Custom and Innovation & Learning. The artifacts were elaborated and operationalized for data collection. The constructs, as well as the OC-Performance relationship framework, were then analyzed and tested using Structural Equation Modeling. Innovation was found to be the most critical OC as far as performance of construction organizations is concerned. In today's knowledge based society, innovative organizations have proved to be the performers. This timely finding highlights the need for a culture that fosters creativity and supports innovation. © 2012 Copyright Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press Technika.","construction; innovation; organizational culture; organizations; performance; Structural Equation Model","","Alas R., Kraus A., Niglas K., Manufacturing strategies and choices in culture contexts, Journal of Business Economics and Management, 10, 4, pp. 279-289, (2009); Amaratunga D., Baldry D., Sarshan M., Process improvement through performance measurement: the balanced scorecard methodology, Work Study, 50, 5, pp. 179-188, (2001); Ankrah N.A., Langford D.A., Architects and contractors: a comparative study of organizational cultures, Construction Management and Economics, 23, 6, pp. 595-607, (2005); Arbuckle J.L., Wothke W., Amos 4.0 User's Guide, (1999); Barney J., Strategic factor markets: expectations, luck, and business strategy, Management Science, 32, 10, pp. 1231-1241, (1986); Bayliss R., Cheung S.O., Suen C.H.H., Wong S.P., Effective partnering tools in construction: a Case Study on MTRC TKE Contract 604 in Hong Kong, International Journal of Project Management, 22, 3, pp. 253-263, (2004); Bresnen M., Marshall N., Motivation, commitment and the use of incentives in partnerships and alliances, Journal of Construction Management and Economics, 18, 5, pp. 587-598, (2000); Butler J.K., Toward understanding and measuring conditions of trust: evolution of a conditions of trust inventory, Journal of Management, 17, 3, pp. 643-665, (1991); Cameron K.S., Quinn R.E., Diagnosing and Changing Organizational Culture Based on the Competing Values Framework, (1999); Cheng C.W.M., Liu A.M.M., The relationship of organizational culture and the implementation of total quality management in construction firms, Surveying and Build Environment, 18, 1, pp. 7-16, (2007); Cheung S.O., Wong S.P., Wu W.Y., Towards an organizational culture framework in construction, International Journal of Project Management, 29, 1, pp. 33-44, (2010); Cole G.A., Personnel Management, (1997); Construct for excellence, (2001); Cummings L.L., Bromiley P., The Organizational Trust Inventory, Trust in Organisation, (1996); Denison D.R., Corporate Culture and Organizational Effectiveness, (1990); Egan J., Rethinking Construction, (1998); Gordon G.G., DiTomaso N., Predicting corporate performance from organizational culture, Journal of Management Studies, 29, pp. 783-798, (1992); Hair J.F., Anderson R.E., Tatham R.L., Black W.C., Multivariate Data Analysis, (1998); Hammer M., Deep change: how operational innovation can transform your company, Harvard Business Review, 82, 9, pp. 85-93, (2004); Hartmann A., The role of organizational culture in motivating innovative behaviour in construction firms, Construction Innovation, 6, 3, pp. 159-172, (2006); Hartmann A., The context of innovation management in construction firms, Construction Management and Economics, 24, 6, pp. 567-578, (2006); Hofstede G., Culture's Consequences: Comparing Values, Behaviors, Institutions, and Organizations Across Nations, (2001); Joreskog K., Sorbom D., LISREL 8: Users Reference Guide, (1996); Kagioglou M., Cooper R., Aouad G., Performance management in construction: a conceptual framework, Construction Management and Economics, 19, 1, pp. 85-95, (2001); Kaplan R.S., Norton D.P., The Balanced Scorecard: measures that drive performance, Harvard Business Review, 70, 1, pp. 71-79, (1992); Kululanga G.K., Edum-Fotwe F.T., McCaffer R., Measuring construction contractors' organizational learning, Building Research and Information, 29, 1, pp. 21-29, (2001); Law K.M.Y., Chuah K.B., Project-based action as learning approach in learning organization: the theory and framework, Team Performance Management, 10, 7-8, pp. 178-186, (2004); Liu A.M., Culture in the Hong Kong real-estate profession: a trait approach, Habitat International, 23, 3, pp. 413-425, (1999); Mohamed S., Scorecard approach to benchmarking organizational safety culture in construction, Journal of Construction Engineering and Management ASCE, 129, 1, pp. 80-88, (2003); Molenaar K., Washington S., Diekmann J., Structural equation model of construction contract dispute potential, Journal of Construction Engineering and Management, 126, 4, pp. 268-277, (2000); Ozorhon B., Arditi D., Dikmen I., Birgonul M.T., Implications of culture in the performance of international construction joint ventures, Journal of Construction Engineering and Management ASCE, 134, 5, pp. 361-370, (2008); Peters T.J., Waterman R.H., In Search of Excellence: Lessons from America's Best-run Companies, (1982); Schein E.H., Organizational Culture and Leadership: A Dynamic View, (1985); Sexton M., Barrett P., Appropriate innovation in small construction firms, Construction Management and Economics, 21, 6, pp. 623-633, (2003); Sharma S., Applied Multivariate Techniques, pp. 116-123, (1996); Smircich L., Concepts of culture and organizational analysis, Admin.

In order to reevaluate and elucidate ‘what and where’ to focus on while redesigning AIM’s credit and training programs, this action research project was initiated to examine the role of strategic orientation (i.e., market and interaction orientations) on innovation orientation and the performance of women micro-entrepreneurs in Malaysia. Findings of this study revealed that market orientation and interaction orientation have a significant positive effect on innovation orientation. Findings also noted a positive and significant effect of innovation orientation on micro-enterprise performance.

It investigates whether engagement with different stakeholders promotes sustainable innovation. Design/methodology/approach - The empirical analysis is based on an international sample of 656 large companies, drawn from the annual assessment for the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes. A logistic regression analysis was performed in order to test the hypothesized relationships between stakeholder interaction, knowledge management and sustainable innovation orientation. Findings - Empirical results showed that knowledge sourced from engagement with internal and external stakeholders contributes to a firm's sustainable innovation orientation, but that this knowledge has to be managed by the firm internally in order to be converted into new ideas for innovation. Research limitations/implications - Since the present study represents one of the first attempts to characterize stakeholder-driven innovation in a quantitative way, there are some limitations related to the used database that should be addressed in future research. Practical implications - The results show the importance for companies of connecting the business functions of stakeholder engagement and innovation, and find flexible mechanisms to combine access and transformation of relevant stakeholder information. Originality/value - The main contribution of the present research is to prove quantitatively that engagement with different stakeholders is a valid mechanism for promoting sustainable innovation within firms.

As a kind of informal economical organizations, copycat-style firms in many emerging economies play an important role in their development of the economics. The development of Shanzhai firms, Chinese-style copycat firms, from imitation to innovation has become an important micro-foundation of China’s economic growth and the manufacturing development. With the cluster development of the Chinese mobile phone industry as the macro and industrial environment background, this paper chose Beijing Tianyu Communication Equipment Co. Ltd as the typical example of innovation in Shanzhai firms and studied the evolution of innovation-based dynamic capabilities in this company. Design/methodology/approach – This paper chose Beijing Tianyu Communication Equipment Co. Ltd as the typical example of innovation in Shanzhai firms and studied the evolution of innovation-based dynamic capabilities in this company by adopting the leading-edge dynamic capability theory, innovation theory and industrial cluster theory. The authors further discussed how to improve the dynamic capabilities in Shanzhai firms in China. Findings – It is finally suggested that Shanzhai firms should reduce innovation failures and lower damage degree of dynamic capabilities through consistent innovation and paying attention to their innovation improvement. Originality/value – It will be very significant to research the survival or diminishing of Shanzhai firms from a theoretical perspective, which will eventually enhance property right protection and innovation development in China. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Dynamic capabilities; Innovation; Shanzhai firms; Tianyu","","Barney J., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage, Journal of Management, 17, 1, pp. 99-120, (1991); Eisenhardt K.M., Martin J.A., Dynamic capabilities: what are they?, Strategic Management Journal, 21, 10-11, pp. 1105-1121, (2000); Fu X., Exports, technical progress and productivity growth in a transition economy: a non-parametric approach for China, Applied Economics, 37, 7, pp. 725-739, (2005); Keane M., Zhao E., Renegades on the frontier of innovation: the Shanzhai grassroots communities of Shenzhen in China’s creative economy, Eurasian Geography and Economics, 53, 2, pp. 216-230, (2012); Lee C.K., Hung S.C., Institutional entrepreneurship in the Informal economy: Chinese Shanzhai mobile phones, Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal, 14, 8, pp. 16-36, (2014); Luo Y., Sun J., Wang S.L., Emerging economy copycats: capability, environment, and strategy, The Academy of Management Perspectives, 25, 2, pp. 37-56, (2011); Mota J., de Castro L.M., Relationship portfolios and capability development: cases from the moulds industry, Journal of Purchasing and Supply Management, 11, 1, pp. 42-54, (2005); Mullins J.W., Early growth decisions of entrepreneurs: the influence of competency and prior performance under changing market conditions, Journal of Business Venturing, 11, 2, pp. 89-105, (1996); Nelson R.R., Winter S.G., Evolutionary theorizing in economics, The Journal of Economic Perspectives, 16, 2, pp. 23-46, (2002); Penrose E.T., The Theory of the Growth of the Firm, (1959); Ren R., A study on informal economic organization under multiple perspectives: theory frontiers and trends, Journal of Sun Yat-sen University (Social Science Edition), 53, 6, pp. 182-191, (2013); Teece D.J., Competition, cooperation, and innovation: organizational arrangements for regimes of rapid technological progress, Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization, 18, 1, pp. 1-25, (1992); Teece D.J., Explicating dynamic capabilities: the nature and microfoundations of (sustainable) enterprise performance, Strategic Management Journal, 28, 13, pp. 1319-1350, (2007); Teece D.J., Dynamic Capabilities and Strategic Management, (2009); Teece D.J., Pisano G., Shuen A., Dynamic capabilities and strategic management, Strategic Management Journal, 18, 7, pp. 509-533, (1997); Webb J.W., Tihanyi L., Ireland R.D., Sirmon D.G., You say illegal, I say legitimate: entrepreneurship in the informal economy, The Academy of Management Review, 34, 3, pp. 492-510, (2009); Yin R., Case Study Research: Design and Methods, (1994); Zhu S., Shi Y., Shanzhai manufacturing – an alternative innovation phenomenon in China: its value chain and implications for Chinese science and technology policies, Journal of Science and Technology Policy in China, 1, 1, (2010); Zollo M., Winter S.G., Deliberate learning and the evolution of dynamic capabilities, Organization Science, 13, 3, pp. 339-351, (2002); Afuah A., Innovation Management: Strategies, Implementation, and Profits, (1998); Barringer B.R., Jones F.F., Neubaum D.O., A quantitative content analysis of the characteristics of rapid-growth firms and their founders, Journal of Business Venturing, 20, 5, pp. 663-687, (2005); Bierly P.E., Chakrabarti A.K., Technological learning, strategic flexibility, and new product development in the pharmaceutical industry, IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, 43, 4, pp. 368-380, (1996); Chandler A.D., The enduring logic of industrial success, Harvard Business Review, 68, 2, pp. 130-140, (1990); Cliff J.E., Does one size fit all?

Subsequently, how can companies sustain a long-run competitive advantage, especially in the face of increasing competition? Apart from the pat answer that innovation is critical to organizational survival, we argue that it is the innovation process and how companies manage it that forms the foundation of a resilient organization. Our research finds that organizational innovation processes take three main forms: reactive, proactive, and anticipatory innovators. It is from anticipatory innovators that resilient organizations emerge. Here, resilient organizations not only anticipate the needs of buyers but do so by creating an innovation orientation within the firm's culture. This culture-based focus goes beyond any specific innovation; it directs leaders to create an organizational culture that is receptive to innovative ideas and to the changes they produce. Here, the competitive advantage is not so much innovation per se but the organization's ability to continuously create competitive advantages based on innovations. © 2013 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University.","C-Suite; Innovation; Organizational culture; Resilience; Strategy; Sustainable competitive advantage; Sustainable growth","","Barney J., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage, Journal of Management, 17, 1, pp. 99-120, (1991); Christensen C., Creating advantage, Leadership Excellence, 23, 2, (2006); Christensen C., The innovator's dilemma: The revolutionary book that will change the way you do business, (2011); Darwin C., The origin of species, (1859); D'Aveni R., Hypercompetition: Managing the dynamics of strategic maneuvering, (1994); Hamel G., Prahalad C.K., Competing for the future, (1994); Hamel G., Valikangas L., The quest for resilience, Harvard Business Review, 81, 9, pp. 52-63, (2003); Isaacson W., Steve Jobs, (2011); Miles R.E., Snow C.C., Organizational strategy, structure, and process, (1978); Moore J., Sonsino S., Leadership unplugged: The new renaissance of value propositions, (2003); Guidelines for collecting and interpreting innovation data, (2005); O'Reilly C.A., Tushman M.L., The ambidextrous organization, Harvard Business Review, 82, 4, pp. 74-81, (2004); Porter M., Competitive strategy: Techniques for analyzing industries and competitors, (1980); Schumpeter J., Business cycles: A theoretical, historical, and statistical analysis of the capitalist, (1939); Schumpeter J., Capitalism, socialism, and democracy, (1942); Wernerfelt B., A resource-based view of the firm, Strategic Management Journal, 5, 2, pp. 171-180, (1984); Werther W.B., Kerr J.L., The shifting sands of competitive advantage, Business Horizons, 38, 3, pp. 11-17, (1995); Wilson D., Dragusanu R., The expanding middle: The exploding world middle class and falling global inequality, Global Economics Paper No: 170, (2008); International trade statistics 2009, (2009)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84876799604"

Design/methodology/approach: The paper adopts a contingent approach that examines the two organizational factors in determining the shape of the SB-IP curve. The empirical study is based on survey data gathered from 414 Chinese firms. In dealing with concerns on simultaneity and reverse causality, perceived time-lag between outcome variable and explanatory variables was introduced. Findings: This study reveals that knowledge novelty and absorptive capacity are two functions underlying the SB-IP relationship. The results also indicate that innovation orientation and firm age moderate the SB-IP relationship in different ways: the more innovation-oriented the firm, the steeper the inverted U-shaped SB-IP relationship will be, while the older the firm, the flatter the SB-IP relationship will be. Interestingly, there is strong evidence for the shape-flip phenomenon of the SB-IP curve: SB has an inverted U-shaped effect on IP when a firm is young; however, SB has a U-shaped effect when the firm is older than 37 years. Originality/value: By revealing two underlying functions and two moderators of the association between SB and IP at the firm level, this paper contributes to shed some new light to the mixed results reported by previous empirical studies that have examined the effect of knowledge search on firm innovation. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Firm age; Innovation orientation; Innovation performance; Knowledge search strategy; Search breadth","","Amabile T.M., Motivating creativity in organizations: on doing what you love and loving what you do, California Management Review, 40, 1, pp. 39-58, (1997); Amara N., Landry R., Sources of information as determinants of novelty of innovation in manufacturing firms: evidence from the 1999 statistics Canada innovation survey, Technovation, 25, 3, pp. 245-259, (2005); Anderson B.S., Eshima Y., The influence of firm age and intangible resources on the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation and firm growth among Japanese SMEs, Journal of Business Venturing, 28, 3, pp. 413-429, (2013); Ardito L., Messeni Petruzzelli A., Breadth of external knowledge sourcing and product innovation: the moderating role of strategic human resource practices, European Management Journal, 35, 2, pp. 261-272, (2017); Armstrong J., Overton T., Estimating nonresponse bias in mail surveys, Journal of Marketing Research, 14, 3, pp. 396-402, (1977); Arora A., Belenzon S., Rios L.A., Make, buy, organize: the interplay between research, external knowledge, and firm structure, Strategic Management Journal, 35, 3, pp. 317-337, (2014); Balasubramanian N., Lee J., Firm age and innovation, Industrial and Corporate Change, 17, 5, pp. 1019-1047, (2008); Barney J., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage, Journal of Management, 17, 1, pp. 99-120, (1991); Bellamy M.A., Ghosh S., Hora M., The influence of supply network structure on firm innovation, Journal of Operations Management, 32, 6, pp. 357-373, (2014); Belsley D.A., Conditioning Diagnostics – Collinearity and Weak Data in Regression, (1991); Berchicci L., Towards an open R&D system: internal R&D investment, external knowledge acquisition and innovative performance, Research Policy, 42, pp. 117-127, (2013); Bercovitz J.E., Feldman M.P., Fishing upstream: firm innovation strategy and university research alliances, Research Policy, 36, 7, pp. 930-948, (2007); Bettis R.A., Prahalad C.K., The dominant logic: retrospective and extension, Strategic Management Journal, 16, 1, pp. 5-14, (1995); Brislin R.W., Back-translation for cross-cultural research, Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 1, 3, pp. 185-216, (1970); Cassiman B., Veugelers R., In search of complementarity in innovation strategy: internal R&D and external knowledge acquisition, Management Science, 52, pp. 68-82, (2006); Chen J., Chen Y., Vanhaverbeke W., The influence of scope, depth, and orientation of external technology sources on the innovative performance of Chinese firms, Technovation, 31, 8, pp. 362-373, (2011); Chiang Y.H., Hung K.-P., Exploring open search strategies and perceived innovation performance from the perspective of inter-organizational knowledge flows, R&D Management, 40, pp. 292-299, (2010); Choi S.B., Lee S.H., Williams C., Ownership and firm innovation in a transition economy: evidence from China, Research Policy, 40, 3, pp. 441-452, (2011); Clauss T., Spieth P., Treat your suppliers right! aligning strategic innovation orientation in captive supplier relationships with relational and transactional governance mechanisms, R&D Management, 46, pp. 1044-1061, (2016); Coad A., Segarra A., Teruel M., Innovation and firm growth: does firm age play a role?, Research Policy, 45, 2, pp. 387-400, (2016); Cohen W.M., Levinthal D.A., Absorptive capacity: a new perspective on learning and innovation, Administrative Science Quarterly, 35, 1, pp. 128-152, (1990); Criscuolo P., Nicolaou N., Salter A., The elixir (or burden) of youth?

Using a sample of Canadian organizations, this study examines the relationships between an organization's innovation orientation and the types of competitive strategies they pursue. An innovation orientation describes how innovative an organization is and the results suggest that such an orientation provides a context for the implementation of proactive growth-based strategies. Organizations that possess high innovation orientations engage in value creation strategies such as market segmentation, developing new products/services for new markets, and product or service customisation. Those organizations possessing low innovation orientations generally practice less aggressive and internally focused strategies, de-emphasising such things as customer service, brand reputation, and co-operation based strategies such as joint ventures and alliances. © 2010 Imperial College Press.","Innovation; Market orientation; Organizational culture; Strategy","","Amit R., Schoemaker P., Strategic assets and organizational rent, Strategic Management Journal, 14, 1, pp. 33-46, (1993); Arthur D.L., Global survey on innovation, The Innovation Premium, pp. 115-137, (1994); Arthur D.L., Global Innovation Excellence Study, (2005); Bowen D.E., Shiel C., Schneider B., A framework for analyzing customer servive orientations in manufacturing, Academy of Management Review, 14, 1, pp. 75-95, (1989); Cattell R.B., Factor analysis: An introduction to essentials.

This study explores how firms can achieve product innovation through innovation orientation and planning processes. The results of our study on innovation management are based on a survey study of 241 firms in the Consumer Electronic Industry. We find that the two prominent types of planning processes, the emergent and the deliberate approach, affect both innovation orientation and market performance. The effects on incremental innovation and the right choice of planning strongly depend on the level of uncertainty. © 2007, Inderscience Publishers.","Innovation management; Innovation orientation; Innovation strategy; Planning process","Consumer electronics; Industrial management; Strategic planning; Innovation management; Innovation orientation; Innovation","Adams R., Bessant J., Phelps R., Innovation management measurement: A review, Int.

Notwithstanding the individuality of the staff members, their actions are collectively bound by the organizational culture. A review of the literature in this topic reveals that despite a number of organizational culture models have been developed, these are mainly for generic business settings and there has yet one developed for construction contracting organizations. This paper reports a study for this purpose conducted in Hong Kong. Firstly, artifacts of organizational culture were long-listed through a literature review. Construction professionals working for developers, consultant offices and contractors assessed the appropriateness of using these artifacts to identify organizational culture in construction. Through a principal component factor analysis, these artifacts are arranged into a seven-factor organizational culture framework. The seven factors are 'Goal settings and accomplishment', 'Team orientation', 'Coordination and integration', 'Performance emphasis', 'Innovation orientation', 'Members' participation' and 'Reward orientation'. The ANOVA result suggests no significant difference in the rankings across respondents working for developers, consultants and contractors. The relative importance rankings among these factors were also assessed according to their significance scores. The findings of the study suggest that the construction contracting organizations in Hong Kong favor culture of clear goals with stability. They are less externally focused with a relatively lower emphasis on innovation. These findings suggest construction maintains a local industry mentality. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd and IPMA.","Artifacts; Factors; Framework; Organizational culture in construction","China; Hong Kong; Contractors; Plastics molding; Artifacts; Construction professionals; Contracting organizations; Factor analysis; Factors; Framework; Goal setting; Hong-kong; Literature reviews; Organizational cultures; Principal Components; Relative importance; Staff members; construction industry; cultural identity; factor analysis; industrial practice; organizational framework; principal component analysis; Principal component analysis","Adenfelt M., Lagerstrom K., Enabling knowledge creation and sharing in transnational projects, Int.

Still, some studies show that alternative orientations can also substantially affect the performance of firms, and furthermore, that firms that combine market orientation with alternative orientations are likely to perform even better than firms adopting only market orientation. Also, the nature of the relationship between market orientation and other strategic orientations is not clear. The purpose of this paper is to deal with these discrepancies in the marketing literature. It highlights the importance of the study of the relationship between market orientation and alternative strategic orientations, examines the effect of market orientation on different orientations, and identifies the orientations that are more likely to be combined with market orientation. Design/methodology/approach - The study employs a meta-analysis procedure to synthesize empirical results on the relationship between market orientation and innovation, learning, entrepreneurial, and employee orientations. Findings - Findings suggest that market orientation is strongly correlated with learning, entrepreneurial, and employee orientations, and that it has a moderate positive relationship with innovation orientation. Research limitations/implications - Research on market orientation should shift its focus, moving from the study of the direct effect of market orientation on business performance to the study of the various combinations of strategic orientations that firms can pursue in different situations, studying how the more successful market-oriented firms balance between market orientation and other strategic orientations. Originality/value - This is the first meta-analysis to examine the relationships between market orientation and alternative strategic orientations. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business performance; Market orientation; Statistical analysis; Strategic marketing","","Agarwal S., Erramilli K., Dev C., Market orientation and performance in service firms: Role of innovation, Journal of Services Marketing, 17, 1, pp. 68-82, (2003); Appiah-Adu K., Market orientation and performance: Do the findings established in large firms hold in the small business sector?, Journal of Euro-marketing, 6, 3, pp. 1-26, (1997); Atuahene-Gima K., An exploratory analysis of the impact of market orientation on new product performance, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 12, pp. 275-93, (1995); Atuahene-Gima K., Market orientation and innovation, Journal of Business Research, 35, pp. 93-103, (1996); Atuahene-Gima K., Ko A., An empirical investigation of the effect of market orientation and entrepreneurship orientation alignment on product innovation, Organization Science, 12, 1, pp. 54-74, (2001); Baker W., Sinkula J., The synergistic effect of market orientation on organizational performance, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 27, 4, pp. 411-27, (1999); Baker W., Sinkula J., Learning orientation, market orientation, and innovation: Integrating and extending models of organizational performance, Journal of Market Focused Management, 4, 4, pp. 295-308, (1999); Bamberger P., Kluger A., Suchard R., The antecedents and consequences of union commitment: A meta-analysis, Academy of Management Journal, 42, 3, pp. 304-17, (1999); Barrett H., Weinstein A., The effect of market orientation and organizational flexibility on corporate entrepreneurship, Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, 23, 1, pp. 57-70, (1998); Becherer R., Maurer J., The moderating effect of environmental variables on the entrepreneurial and marketing orientation of entrepreneur-led firms, Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, 22, 1, pp. 47-58, (1997); Bhuian S., Abdul-Gader A., Market orientation in the hospital industry, Marketing Health Services, pp. 37-45, (1997); Bhuian S., Menguc B., Bell S., Just entrepreneurial enough: The moderating effect of entrepreneurship on the relationship between market orientation and performance, Journal of Business Research, 58, pp. 9-17, (2005); Cadogan J., Sundqvist S., Salminen R., Puumalainen K., Market-oriented behavior: Comparing service with product exporters, European Journal of Marketing, 36, 910, pp. 1076-102, (2002); Calantone R., Garcia R., Droge C., The effects of environment turbulence on new product development and strategy planning, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 20, 2, pp. 90-103, (2003); Campbell-Hunt C., What have we learned about generic competitive strategy?

We address this gap in two ways. First, we examine the influence of four key strategic marketing concepts-market orientation, innovation orientation, and two marketing capability categories (outside-in and inside-out capabilities)-on company performance. Second, these relationships are studied in three European ""engineering countries:"" Austria, Finland and Germany. Their relative homogeneity enables testing the generality versus context-specificity of strategic marketing's performance impact. Using SEM analysis, surprisingly weak relationships between market orientation and outside-in capabilities, and business performance are identified, as opposed to the strong role of inside-out capabilities and innovation orientation. These results can be understood through the ""engineering country"" characteristics. Moreover, clear differences in results are identified among these relatively homogenous countries.

Firms that adopt this innovative way to sell or deliver services and manage customer relationships must make technological and strategic changes. Firms in the same industry adopt e-business at different rates. Why do some firms actively implement e-business, and others take a more cautious attitude? Drawing on several research streams (innovation adoption research, institutional theory, strategic orientation theory, and upper-echelon theory), this article proposes a multi-level model to explain e-business adoption by service firms. The model was empirically tested using survey and interview data from travel agencies in Taiwan. External competitive pressure, innovation orientation, financial slack, and IT resources were found to be associated with two measures of e-business adoption. CEO risk-taking propensity and firm size also had an interaction effect on e-business adoption. Interviews with CEOs indicate that most travel agencies in Taiwan are not yet ready to apply mobile technologies in their daily business. The slow progress of mobile e-business was largely attributed to the limited capacity of mobile devices and the misfit between travel product characteristics, consumer behavior, and current mobile solutions. © 2004 M.E.

An innovation orientation describes an organisation's degree of innovativeness. This exploratory study examines the relationships between innovation and organisational performance in a sample of Canadian organisations. The results suggest that an innovation orientation is related to overall organisational performance. The high innovating firms had a positive relationship with the top line growth, and customer satisfaction, and bottom line growth, and profitability. There was a positive relationship between return on investment and innovation orientation. Those organisations possessing low innovation orientations had lower firm performance and enterprise value. Significant negative correlations were identified with return on investment, overall firm performance and the overall enterprise value.

This is grounded in the wealth of customers' knowledge due to their product and market experiences. Therefore, customer involvement may provide access to innovative product ideas, new technologies, market information, and development capabilities that the manufacturer lacks in-house. Whilst much has been written about the potential benefits of partnering with customers, only few researchers have attempted to document empirically the factors that foster customer involvement in NPD. This study examines the influence of relationship management tasks on customer involvement in NPD using data from more than 233 supplier-customer relationships. Our findings suggest that five relationship management tasks have a strong impact on customer involvement in NPD. Relationship sponsoring, technological consulting, information brokering, representing interests, and coordinating cooperative activities are crucial for integrating customers into NPD processes. Mutual trust and mutual commitment as well as mutual adaptations by the partner firms are further important factors for customer involvement in NPD. Based on these findings, this study discusses several theoretical and managerial implications.","Adaptation; Commitment; Customer involvement; Customer orientation; Innovation orientation; International relationships; Relationship management; Trust","Customer satisfaction; Professional aspects; Research and development management; New product development (NPD); Product development","Brown S.L., Eisenhardt K.M., Product development: Past research, present findings, and future directions, Academy of Management Review, 20, 2, pp. 343-378, (1995); Cooper R.G., Kleinschmidt E.J., New product success factors: A comparison of 'kills' versus successes and failures, R&D Management, 20, 1, pp. 47-63, (1990); Cooper R.G., The new product process: An empirically-based classification scheme, R&D Management, 13, 1, pp. 1-13, (1983); Cooper R.G., Overall corporate strategies for new product programs, Industrial Marketing Management, 14, 3, pp. 183-189, (1985); Biemans W.G., Managing Innovation Within Networks, (1992); Gemunden H.G., Heydebreck P., Herden R., Technological interweavement - A means of achieving innovation success, R&D Management, 22, 4, pp. 359-376, (1992); Gemunden H.G., Ritter T., Heydebreck P., Network configuration and innovation success: An empirical analysis in German high-tech industries, International Journal of Research in Marketing, 13, 5, pp. 449-462, (1996); Hakansson H., Industrial Technological Development: A Network Approach, (1987); Handfield R.B., Ragatz G.L., Petersen K.J., Monczka R.M., Involving suppliers in new product development, California Management Review, 42, 1, pp. 59-82, (1999); LaBahn D.W., Krapfel R., Early supplier involvement in customer new product development: A contingency model of component supplier intentions, Journal of Business Research, 47, 3, pp. 173-190, (2000); Mabert V.A., Muth J.F., Schmenner R.W., Collapsing new product development times: Six case studies, J.

The study explores whether the degree of adoption of the aforementioned model is influenced by contingency factors such as company size or technological level. Design/methodology/approach An ad hoc questionnaire was addressed to the chief executive officers of the companies. Structural equation modelling based on partial least squares was used to test the main hypotheses of the research. Findings Firms which develop a higher organizational learning capacity put a greater emphasis on innovation. Additionally, the innovation focus of companies is positively related to the implementation of management systems which are more in accordance with the middle-up-down management model, and the degree of adoption of the aforementioned model is not influenced by company size or technological level. Originality/value The approach taken in the research serves the purpose of linking extremely abstract concepts from the middle-up-down model with specific elements from the management context. It also contributes to the development of empirical research in the domain of organizational learning, aimed at clarifying the relationship between organizational learning capacity and innovation orientation. The research contributes towards a better understanding of the degree of adoption of such a model in the Basque region, paving the way for future comparative studies which might take other regions of the world into consideration. © 2007, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Innovation;

Despite these investments, contextual contingencies can impact innovation. Our findings show that Chinese manufacturers with cultures emphasizing innovation and teamwork more effectively use financial resources in the innovation process. Findings also demonstrate that the impact of education on innovation is greater with low stability and high teamwork and innovation orientations. Results also indicate that a culture emphasizing outcomes and stability leads to lower levels of innovation irrespective of financial and human resources invested. Finally, we found a negative curvilinear interaction between R&D spending and outcome orientation on innovation. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","China; Innovation; Organizational culture","","Ahuja G., Katila R., Where do resources come from?, The role of idiosyncratic situations.

Although the interaction effect of these two strategic orientations is conceptually recognized as a critical factor for new product's success, empirical results are mixed. This paper examines this issue in terms of innovation orientation, two types of market orientations (responsive and proactive), and new product performance. Based on a sample of 107 high-tech firms, the results of this study show that the interaction between innovation orientation and two types of market orientation yields different patterns of nonlinear responses for new product performance. Specifically, new product performance, when derived from the interaction between innovation orientation and responsive market orientation, is in the form of an inverted U, i.e., the interaction effect is contributory to firm performance until an optimal level is reached, and then the effect becomes detrimental thereafter. However, new product performance derived from innovation orientation and proactive market orientation is in the form of a U, i.e., the interaction effect is detrimental to firm performance until a threshold level is reached and then the effect becomes contributory thereafter. The different patterns of new product performance indicate that the costs and organizational learning effects of these two strategic orientation interactions are dissimilar. The paper concludes with a discussion of theoretical and practical implications of these findings. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Innovation orientation; New product performance; Proactive market orientation; Responsive market orientation","Industry; Philosophical aspects; Business activities; Critical factors; Empirical results; Firm Performance; High-tech firms; High-tech industries; Interaction effect; Market orientation; New product; New product performance; Non-linear model; Non-linear response; Optimal level; Organizational learning; Strategic orientation; Threshold levels; business development; high technology industry; innovation; market development; nonlinearity; numerical model; product development; Commerce","Berthon P., Hulbert J., Pitt L., To serve or create?

At the same time, in order to respond effectively to shifting market conditions, managers throughout the firm must be willing and able to disseminate and respond to market research designed to alert firms to shifts in market conditions. However, little work has focused on how creating a flexible firm orientation affects the way market research is disseminated and used. This article reports the findings of a study designed to enhance our knowledge in this area. The study suggests that firms attempting to create flexibility can lean toward an innovation orientation (encouraging new ideas) or a speed orientation (encouraging a rapid response). The study also suggests that firms which have an innovative orientation tend to use disseminated market research in a way that is consistent with the findings of the research. On the other hand, firms which have a speed orientation tend to use market research in a way that is less consistent with its findings. © 2006 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Innovation; Marketing strategy, market research use; Organization culture","","Amabile T., How to kill creativity, Harvard Business Review, 76, pp. 76-87, (1998); Anderson J.C., Gerbing D.W., Structural equation modeling in practice: A review and recommended two–step approach, Psychological Bulletin, 103, pp. 411-423, (1988); Astley G.W., Van de Ven A.H., Central perspectives and debates in organization theory, Administrative Science Quarterly, 28, pp. 245-273, (1983); Beyer J.M., Trice H.M., The utilization process: A conceptual framework and synthesis of empirical findings, Administrative Science Quarterly, 27, pp. 591-622, (1982); Boynton A.C., Victor B., Beyond flexibility: Building and managing the dynamically stable organization, California Management Review, 34, pp. 53-66, (1991); Brown S.L., Eisenhardt K., Product innovation as core capability: The art of dynamic adaptation, Working Paper, (1995); Burgelman R., Managing the new venture division: Research findings and implications for strategic management, Strategic Management Journal, 6, (1985); Caplan N., Morrison A., Stambaugh R., The Use of Social Science Knowledge in Policy Decisions and the National Level, (1975); Curren M.T., Folkes V.S., Steckel J.H., Explanations for successful and unsuccessful marketing decisions: The decision maker's perspective, Journal of Marketing, 56, pp. 18-31, (1992); Deshpande R., The organizational context of market research use, Journal of Marketing, 46, pp. 91-101, (1982); Deshpande R., Farley J., Webster F., Corporate culture, customer orientation, and innovativeness, Journal of Marketing, 57, (1993); Deshpande R., Zaltman G., Factors Affecting the Use of Market Research Information: A Path Analysis, Journal of Marketing Research, pp. 14-31, (1982); Dillman D.A., Mail and Telephone Surveys: The Total Design Method, (1998); Dunn W., Studying knowledge use: A profile of procedures and issues, Knowledge, Generation, Exchange, and Utilization, (1986); Eisenhardt K.M., MartinJeffrey A., Dynamic capabilities: what are they?, Strategic Management Journal, 59, pp. 1105-1120, (2000); Eisenhardt K.M., Tabrizi B.N., Accelerating adaptive processes: Product innovation in the global computer industry, Administrative Science Quarterly, 40, pp. 84-110, (1995); Fisher R.J., Maltz E., Jaworski B.J., Enhancing communication between marketing and engineering: The moderating role of relative functional identification, Journal of Marketing, 61, pp. 54-70, (1997); Fornell C., Larcker D.F., Structural equation models with unobservable variables and measurement error: Algebra and statistics, Journal of Marketing Research, 18, pp. 382-388, (1981); Gersick C.J.G., Pacing strategic change: The case of a new venture, Academy of Management Journal, 37, pp. 9-45, (1994); Glazer R., Marketing in an information–intensive environment: Strategic implications of knowledge as an asset, Journal of Marketing, 55, pp. 1-19, (1991); Golden B., The Past is the Past–Or Is It?

Specific performance measures used were new product success, sales growth and return on investment (ROI). Based on constructs of these measures, a research scale was developed for the study and data were collected via a self-administered mail survey among a UK samples of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The results show a positive effect of customer orientation on SME performance. There are also findings on the varied influences of innovation orientation and the competitive environment on the levels of SME customer orientation. In the light of existing literature, implications of our findings for SME managers, the study's limitations and future research directions are subsequently addressed. © 1998, MCB UP Limited","Competitive advantage;

In addition, service delivery has played a key role in interactions with customers in recent years. Yet, research on the link between innovation and service delivery is scant. This article theoretically and empirically examines innovation in service delivery and its antecedents and consequences. The authors identify innovation orientation, external partner collaboration, and information technology capability as the antecedents of service delivery innovation and analyze the impact of service delivery innovation on firm performance. Respondents were managers in the marketing and information technology departments of financial firms in Taiwan. Overall, 298 responses were received (including 123 paired responses from both department managers). Findings indicated that service delivery innovation contributes to firm performance. These results support the crucial influences of innovation orientation and information technology capability on service delivery innovation. © 2009 The Author(s).","External partner collaboration; Information technology capability; Innovation orientation; Service delivery innovation; Service innovation","","Alam I., Service Innovation Strategy and Process: A Cross-National Comparative Analysis, International Marketing Review, 23, 3, pp. 234-254, (2006); Armstrong J.S., Overton T.S., Estimating Non-Response Bias in Mail Surveys, Journal of Marketing Research, 14, 3, pp. 396-402, (1977); Avlonitis G.J., Papastathopoulou P.G., Gounaris S.P., An Empirically-Based Typology of Product Innovativeness for New Financial Services: Success and Failure Scenarios, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 18, 5, pp. 324-342, (2001); Barclay D.W., Thompson R., Higgins C.A., The Partial Least Squares (PLS) Approach to Causal Modeling: Personal Computer Adoption and Use as an Illustration, Journal of Technology Studies, 2, 2, pp. 285-309, (1995); Barney J., Firm Resources and Sustained Competitive Advantage, Journal of Management, 17, 1, pp. 99-120, (1991); Baum J.A.C., Calabrese T., Silverman B.S., Don't Go It Alone: Alliance Network Composition and Startups' Performance in Canadian Biotechnology, Strategic Management Journal, 21, 3, pp. 267-295, (2000); Berry L.L., Shankar V., Parish J.T., Cadwallader S., Dotzel T., Creating New Markets through Service Innovation, Sloan Management Review, 47, 2, pp. 56-63, (2006); Berthon P., Hulbert J.M., Pitt L.F., To Serve or Create?

The first two of these are forms of technological innovation that are well established in the innovation studies literature. The third is a form of organisational innovation, about which much less is known. Aside from identifying statistically these three modes of innovation, we show that firms of different sizes and in different sectors have different propensities to engage in each of them. High-technology firms are, for example, the most likely of all firms to engage in the product-research mode, whilst low-technology manufacturers are the most likely to engage in the process-technologies mode. Meanwhile, the organisational-cooperation mode, which involves supply-chain rather than research-based cooperative practices, is particularly prominent in services, especially in trade and distribution services. This fits with the view that innovation in services is often 'soft', rather than primarily technological, involving organisational and relational changes within supply-chains or networks. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach – A questionnaire survey was conducted among 227 manufacturing firms in mainland China. A total of six hypotheses related to market orientation, innovation orientation, and new product success as well as moderating effects of innovation orientation and environmental variables are examined by structural equation modeling and hierarchical regression techniques. Findings – The research results show that: first, the conceptual model is superior to the popular model in Western literature in terms of model fit goodness; second, market orientation and innovation orientation have significant and positive impact, which is higher than the average level in previous research, upon new product success; third, innovation orientation and technological turbulence have a positive moderating effect on market orientation-new product performance link; and fourth, market turbulence and competitive intensity have no moderating effects. In addition, managerial implications as to how to improve product innovation performance are provided for Chinese manufacturers. Originality/value – The paper contributes to the extant literature of market orientation and product innovation in the following three ways. First of all, the research empirically validates a modified conceptual model incorporating market orientation, innovation orientation and new product performance. Second, the facilitating impact of strategic orientations (including market orientation and innovation orientation) upon new product performance is higher than the average level in previous studies (primarily based on developed economies), indicating the greater effectiveness of two strategic orientations in transition economy and east-Asian cultural context. Third, by examining the potential moderating roles of innovation orientation and environmental variables, we are able to better understand how to match market orientation strategy with those moderators in order to help enhance the product innovation performance results of manufacturing firms. © 2010, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","China; Innovation; Market orientation; New products; Product development","","Atuahene-Gima K., Market orientation and innovation, Journal of Business Research, 35, pp. 93-103, (1996); Auh S., Menguc B., Top management team diversity and innovativeness: the moderating role of interfunctional coordination, Industrial Marketing Management, 34, 3, pp. 249-261, (2005); Baker W., Sinkula J.M., The synergistic effect of market orientation and learning orientation on organizational performance, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 27, 4, pp. 411-427, (1999); Berthon P., Hulbert J., Pitt L., To serve or to create?

Numerous studies have confirmed the viability and advantages of a market orientation strategy in different sectors and markets. Thus it is surprising that, given the nature of the pharmaceutical industry, there is a relative absence of references on the application of these principles in this industry. The present study attempts to provide exploratory research into the reasons for this absence. For this purpose, a semi-structured telephone interview was carried out with the managing directors of 30 Spanish pharmaceutical companies. The surprising lack of knowledge of the concept and therefore its apparent lack of application in the pharmaceutical industry appears to run counter to the logic and necessary innovation-orientation in this industry. © 2006, SAGE Publications.

Innovation, versus imitation, motivates companies to launch new products and become pioneers on markets. Many factors have been shown to be determinants for supporting an organizational innovative orientation. One of them is organizational culture. The objective of this paper is to analyze the organizational culture that fosters or inhibits organizational innovation and imitation strategy. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses a sample of 471 Spanish companies for examining the hypotheses. Using hierarchical multiple regression analysis, it relates the effect of organizational culture with an innovation strategy. Findings: The results confirm the hypotheses. The paper finds that organizational culture is a clear determinant of innovation strategy. Moreover, adhocracy cultures foster innovation strategies and hierarchical cultures promote imitation cultures. Research limitations/implications: The main limitations are that data in the study were collected from one source for the cross-sectional design of this research. Practical implications: Managers should pay more attention to their organization culture if they pursue innovation/imitation strategies. Moreover, depending on this orientation (to be the first company to introduce in new markets or develop new products for a market versus to follow a pioneer), companies should promote different values and norms in their organizations. Originality/value: The main value of this paper is its analysis and testing of the relation of organizational culture and innovation orientation. The majority of the literature underlines the paper's seeking after organizational culture for innovation. However, this topic has not been studied in depth and requires attention to different organizational cultures and innovation orientations. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Innovation; Organizational culture; Spain","","Adler P., Borys B., Two types of bureaucracy: Enabling and coercive, Administrative Science Quarterly, 41, pp. 61-89, (1996); Ahmed P., Culture and climate for innovation, European Journal of Innovation Management, 1, 1, pp. 30-43, (1998); Al-Khalifa K.N., Aspinwall E.M., Using the competing values framework to identify the ideal culture profile for TQM: A UK perspective, International Journal of Manufacturing Technology & Management, 2, 1-7, pp. 1024-1040, (2000); Ali A., Krapfel R., Labahn D., Product innovativeness and entry strategy: Impact on cycle time and break-even time, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 12, pp. 54-69, (1995); Amabile T.M., How to kill creativity, Harvard Business Review, 76, pp. 77-89, (1998); Arad S., Hanson M., Schneider R., A framework for the study of relationships between organizational characteristics and organizational innovation, The Journal of Creative Behavior, 31, 1, pp. 42-58, (1997); Atuahene-Gima K., Ko A., An empirical investigation of the effect of market orientation and entrepreneurship orientation alignment on product innovation, Organization Science, 12, 1, pp. 54-74, (2001); Baker W.E., Sinkula J.M., Does market orientation facilitate balanced innovation programs?

Based on a survey of 2754 employees from 180 firms in China, we find that both market and innovation orientations strongly improve employees' job attitudes, such as job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and confidence in their firm's future performance. In addition, a participative organizational culture and senior managers' positive attitudes toward change are beneficial to developing market and innovation orientations. Furthermore, charismatic leadership positively impacts employees' job attitudes and facilitates the effects of market and innovation orientations on employees' job attitudes. The implications for developing strategic orientations in transitional economies are also discussed. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

This paper offers a theoretical framework to examine the growth and evolution of software firms from an innovation-orientation perspective. While it is apparent that the attitudes and perceptions of a firm's key stakeholders towards innovative product development hold valuable insights on its future growth and evolution, such a perspective has received limited theoretical attention in studies on firm evolution. In this paper, we define a software firm growth stage model that reflects the changes in a firm's process and product portfolios. We offer a set of research propositions that link the innovation-related attitudes and perceptions of a firm's internal stakeholders to firm evolution. The research model has several important implications for both research and practice and can be extended to other high technology contexts. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

This fact is especially relevant for small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), whose survival depends, among other factors, on the use they make of ICTs to develop new organizational models, compete in new markets or enhance their internal and external communication relationships. Given the relevance of this topic, the present work studies the impact of the adoption of ICT among SMEs. To do this, we first analyze the current situation of the use of ICT among SMEs in order to show their increasing penetration into the business environment. Then, we study the objectives as well as the main challenges behind the adoption of ICT among SMEs. Later, we analyse the entrepreneur as well as the innovation orientation as key factors in the ICT adoption process. Finally, we conclude by reviewing the main benefits that ICT can bring to certain areas of SMEs. © 2007 Virginia Barba-Sánchez, María del Pilar Martínez-Ruiz, Ana Isabel Jiménez-Zarco.","Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs); Innovation orientation; Small and medium sized companies (SMEs)","","Acs Z., Varga A., Entrepreneurship, aglomeration and technological change, Small Business Economics, 24, pp. 323-334, (2005); Achrol R.S., Kotler P., Marketing in the network economy, Journal of Marketing, 63, pp. 146-163, (1999); Ahuja G., Collaboration networks, structural holes, and innovation: A longitudinal study, Administrative Science Quarterly, 45, pp. 425-455, (2000); Anna A.L., Chandler G.N., Jansen E., Mero N.P., Women business owners in traditional and non-traditional industries, Journal of Business Venturing, 15, 3, pp. 279-303, (2000); Athuahene-Gima K., Ko A., An empirical investigaton of the effect of marketing orientation and enterpreneurship orientation, alignment on product innovation, Organization Science, 12, 1, pp. 54-74, (2001); Barney J., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage, Journal of Management, 1, 17, pp. 99-120, (1991); Bates T., Restricted access to markets characterizes women-owned businesses, Journal of Business Venturing, 17, 4, pp. 313-324, (2002); Begley T.M., Using founder status, age of firm, and company growth rate as the basis for distinguishing entrepreneurs from managers of smaller business, Journal of Business Venturing, 10, 3, pp. 249-263, (1995); Benjamin R.J., Rockart M.S., Scott-Morton M., Wyman J., A strategic opportunity, Sloan Management Review, pp. 3-9, (1984); Brady M., Saren M., Tzokas N., Integrating information technology into marketing practice-The IT Realize of contemporary marketing practice, Journal of Marketing Management, 18, pp. 555-577, (2002); Carroll G.R., Mosakowski E., The career dynamics of self-employment, Administrative Science Quarterly, 32, 4, pp. 570-589, (1987); Cela J., Sociedad del conocimiento y sociedad global de la información: implantación y desarrollo en españa, Documentos de Las Ciencias de la Información, 28, pp. 147-158, (2005); Corbitt B.J., Developing intraorganizational electronic commerce strategy: An ethnographic study, Journal of Information Technology, 15, 2, pp. 119-130, (2000); Dahlstrand A.L., Growth and inventiveness in technology-based spin-off firms, Research Policy, 26, 3, pp. 331-344, (1997); De Pablo I., Bueno Y., Rasgos personales que caracterizan a un emprendedor de éxito, Iniciativa Emprendedora y Empresa Familiar, 44, pp. 113-125, (2004); Demartino R., Barbato R., Differences between women and men MBA entrepreneurs: Exploring family flexibility and wealth creation as career motivators, Journal of Business Venturing, 18, 6, pp. 815-832, (2003); De Castro D., Et al., La Empresa en Andalucía, (1995); Duchene B., Orphan M., Woman entrepreneurs in France: Motivations for creating a business, Research in Entrepreneurship and Small Business (Rent XII), pp. 26-27, (1998); Entrialgo M., El Perfil Empresarial Como Factor Determinante de la Estrategia y Competitividad de la Pyme, (1998); Evans M.D.R., Immigrant entrepreneurship: Effects of ethnic market size and isolated labour pool, American Sociological Review, 54, 6, pp. 950-962, (1989); Garcia-Sanchez A., Wandosell G., Motivaciones y obstáculos en la creación de empresas: efectos de la experiencia empresarial, Boletín Económico Del Ice, 2819, pp. 19-36, (2004); Gartner W.B., Are Entrepreneurs Different Than Others?, pp. 11-15, (2002); Gartner W.B., Starr J.A., Bhat S., Predicting new venture survival: An analysis of 'anatomy of a start-up, cases from Inc.

Drawing from work found in the innovation, management, and marketing literatures over the past 35 years, the concept of innovation orientation as a system is conceptualized and defined in this article. The domain of innovation orientation is delineated as a multidimensional knowledge structure and a framework for understanding innovation orientation and its consequences in an organizational context are developed. The framework defines the innovation orientation knowledge structure as composed of a learning philosophy, strategic direction, and transfunctional beliefs within an organization that define and direct the organizational strategies and actions toward specific innovation-enabling competencies and processes. These innovation-oriented firm competencies are in the areas of resource allocation, technology, employees, operations, and markets. The framework then explains that these appropriately developed innovation-enabling competencies lead to innovation outcomes, specifically ideal innovation form, type, and rate that, in turn, affect firm performance. An inventory of propositions for future research that correspond to the innovation orientation concept is also presented in this comprehensive framework. This study provides two important contributions to the existing innovation literature. First, the article examines the vast innovation literature to arrive at a clear definition of the innovation orientation construct to provide a consistent conceptualization for future research.
